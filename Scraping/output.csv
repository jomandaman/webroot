Vannest moved to Indiana from Virginia circa 1816, and secured tracts of   government land on which the City of Clinton, Indiana now stands.   Vannest devoted his life to farming and raising a family, and also   established the first Methodist Society in Vermillion County, holding   meetings every four weeks in his barn. </p> <p>According to <em>Vermillion County, Indiana, History and Family</em> (Turner Publishing, 1989):</p> <blockquote><p><em>""Itinerant  Methodist ministers in  pioneer times were noted for their deep  convictions, powerful  preaching, and their energy and daring in  threading the wild woods and  prairies in search of the isolated settler  for the purpose of preaching  the gospel and organizing Methodist  classes."" </em></p></blockquote>  ",1828,750,0,FALSE,3656,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8C1D566C-1517-6111-28B24269F3CA1269.png,

You'll win here. But it'll be the only damn place you win in this county."" (He was right on both counts.)</li><li> The roller-coaster ride of the 1992 campaign.</li><li> The extraordinarily frank exchanges with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole.</li><li> The delicate manipulation needed to convince Rabin and Arafat to shake hands for the camera while keeping Arafat from kissing Rabin.</li><li> The cost, both public and private, of the scandal that threatened the presidency.</li></ul> <p>         Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions, told openly, directly, in his own completely recognizable voice.

Former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had worked to make the White House a distinctly American showcase â from historically accurate renovations and acquisitions of important American art, to celebrations of jazz and gospel music and an expanded emphasis on American cuisine. The first family's home has also been distinguished by the diversity of Americans honored and welcomed there. In this lavishly illustrated book, the First Lady invites you into the best-known house in the country and celebrates the very best of American history, arts, and culture.</p> <p><em>An Invitation to the White House</em> shows how the White House figures prominently in the cultural and political life of the country, as well as in the life of the first family.

With proof of in-person signing at Elliott Bay Book Company: original receipt and punched admission ticket.  </p> <h3>About President Clinton's Book <em>My Life</em> </h3> <p>President Bill Clinton's <em>My Life</em> is the strikingly candid portrait of a global leader who decided early in life to devote his intellectual and political gifts, and his extraordinary capacity for hard work, to serving the public. <br/> <br/> It shows us the progress of a remarkable American, who, through his own enormous energies and efforts, made the unlikely journey from Hope, Arkansas, to the White House-a journey fueled by an impassioned interest in the political process which manifested itself at every stage of his life: in college, working as an intern for Senator William Fulbright; at Oxford, becoming part of the Vietnam War protest movement; at Yale Law School, campaigning on the grassroots level for Democratic candidates; back in Arkansas, running for Congress, attorney general, and governor.<br/> <br/> We see his career shaped by his resolute determination to improve the life of his fellow citizens, an unfaltering commitment to civil rights, and an exceptional understanding of the practicalities of political life.<br/> <br/> We come to understand the emotional pressures of his youth-born after his father's death; caught in the dysfunctional relationship between his feisty, nurturing mother and his abusive stepfather, whom he never ceased to love and whose name he took; drawn to the brilliant, compelling Hillary Rodham, whom he was determined to marry; passionately devoted, from her infancy, to their daughter, Chelsea, and to the entire experience of fatherhood; slowly and painfully beginning to comprehend how his early denial of pain led him at times into damaging patterns of behavior.<br/> <br/> President Clinton's book is also the fullest, most concretely detailed, most nuanced account of a presidency ever written-encompassing not only the high points and crises but the way the presidency actually works: the day-to-day bombardment of problems, personalities, conflicts, setbacks, achievements.<br/> </p> <ul><li> It is a testament to the positive impact on America and on the world of his work and his ideals.</li><li> It is the gripping account of a president under concerted and unrelenting assault orchestrated by his enemies on the Far Right, and how he survived and prevailed. </li><li> It is a treasury of moments caught alive, among them:</li><li> The ten-year-old boy watching the national political conventions on his family's new (and first) television set.</li><li> The young candidate looking for votes in the Arkansas hills and the local seer who tells him, ""Anybody who would campaign at a beer joint in Joiner at midnight on Saturday night deserves to carry one box. . . . You'll win here. But it'll be the only damn place you win in this county."" (He was right on both counts.)</li><li> The roller-coaster ride of the 1992 campaign.</li><li> The extraordinarily frank exchanges with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole.</li><li> The delicate manipulation needed to convince Rabin and Arafat to shake hands for the camera while keeping Arafat from kissing Rabin.</li><li> The cost, both public and private, of the scandal that threatened the presidency.</li></ul> <p>         Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions, told openly, directly, in his own completely recognizable voice. A unique book by a unique American.</p> Â  <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Dana, Jr.</strong></p></blockquote>   <p>Includes photo of Dana in old age, as shown. </p> <p><strong>RICHARD HENRY DANA JR.</strong> (1815-1882) was an American lawyer and politician, and author of the book <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em>. Dana was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts on August 1, 1815, into a family that first settled in colonial America in 1640, counting Anne Bradstreet among their ancestors. As a boy, Dana studied in Cambridgeport under a strict schoolmaster named Samuel Barrett, alongside fellow Cambridge native and future writer James Russell Lowell. Barrett was infamous as a disciplinarian, punishing his students for any infraction by flogging. He also often pulled students by their ears and, on one such occasion, nearly pulled Dana's ear off, causing his father to protest enough that the practice was abolished.</p>   <p>In 1825, Dana enrolled in a private school overseen by Ralph Waldo Emerson, whom Dana later mildly praised as ""a very pleasant instructor"", though he lacked a ""system or discipline enough to insure regular and vigorous study."" In July 1831, Dana began his studies at Harvard College, though he was suspended for six months before the end of his first year for supporting a student protest. In his junior year, he had a case of measles which also caused ophthalmia and his weakening vision inspired him to take a sea voyage.</p>   <p>Rather than going on a Grand Tour of Europe, he decided to enlist as a common sailor, despite his high-class birth. He left Boston on the brig <em>Pilgrim</em> on August 14, 1834, on a voyage around Cape Horn to the then-remote California, at that time still a part of Mexico. On the 180-ton, 86.5 feet-long Pilgrim, Dana visited a number of settlements in California (including Monterey, San Pedro, San Juan Capistrano, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Clara), and San Francisco. He returned to Massachusetts aboard the ship <em>Alert</em> on September 22, 1836, after two years away from home.</p>   <p>He kept a diary, and after the trip wrote <em>Two Years Before the Mast</em> based on his experiences. The term ""before the mast"" refers to sailor's quarters -- in the forecastle, in the bow of the ship, the officers dwelling near the stern. His writing evidences his later social feeling for the oppressed. After witnessing a flogging on board the Pilgrim, he vowed that he would try to help improve the lot of the common seaman.</p>   <p>After his sea voyage, he returned to Harvard to take up study at its law school, completing his education in 1837. He subsequently became a lawyer, and an expert on maritime law, many times defending common seamen, and wrote The Seaman's Friend, which became a standard reference text on the legal rights and responsibilities of sailors.</p> <p>The point and city of Dana Point, California, located on the Pacific coast about halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego, are named for him, and a reproduction of the brigantine <em>Pilgrim</em> was sailed around Cape Horn and permanently placed on display there for the Orange County Ocean Institute.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Letter is clipped to 8.5"" x 7"", and is in excellent condition with usual folds. </strong></p> <p><strong>ALLEN WELSH DULLES</strong> (1893-1969) was the first civilian and the longest serving (1953-61) director of central intelligence (de facto head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency) and a member of the Warren Commission. Between stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell. Allen W. Dulles was one of the directors of the J. Henry Schroder bank.  </p> <strong></strong>   <p>In 1953, Dulles became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence, which had been formed as part of the National Security Act of 1947; earlier directors had been military officers. The Agency's covert operations were an important part of the Eisenhower administration's new Cold War national security policy known as the ""New Look"". Under Dulles's direction, the CIA created MK-Ultra, a top secret mind control research project which was managed by Sidney Gottlieb. Dulles also personally oversaw Operation Mockingbird, a program that influenced American media companies as part of the ""New Look"".</p>   <p>Dulles went on to be successful with the CIA's first attempts at removing foreign leaders by covert means. Notably, the elected Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh of Iran was deposed in 1953 (via Operation Ajax), and President Arbenz of Guatemala was removed in 1954. The Guatemalan coup was carried out under the CIA code-name Operation PBSUCCESS. Dulles was on the board of the United Fruit Company. Dulles saw these kind of clandestine activities as an essential part of the struggle against communism.</p>   <p>During the Kennedy Administration, Dulles faced increasing criticism. The failed Bay of Pigs Invasion and several failed assassination plots utilizing CIA-recruited operatives from the Mafia and anti-Castro Cubans directly against Fidel Castro undermined the CIA's credibility, and pro-American but unpopular regimes in Iran and Guatemala that he helped put in place were widely regarded as brutal and corrupt. The reputation of the agency and its director declined after the Bay of Pigs Invasion fiasco; in September 1961 he and his staff were forced to resign. President Kennedy did not trust the CIA, and he reportedly intended to dismantle it after the Bay of Pigs failure. Kennedy said he wanted to ""splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it into the winds.""</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Very good condition.</p> <p><strong>MILLARD FILLMORE</strong> (1800-1874) was the thirteenth President of the United States, serving from 1850 until 1853, and the last member of the Whig Party to hold that office. He was the second Vice President to assume the Presidency upon the death of a sitting President, succeeding Zachary Taylor who died of what is thought to be acute gastroenteritis or hyperthermia (heat stroke). Fillmore was never elected President; after serving out Taylor's term, he failed to gain the nomination for the Presidency of the Whigs in the 1852 presidential election, and, four years later, in the 1856 presidential election, he again failed to win election as the Know Nothing Party and Whig candidate.</p> <p>Fillmore ascended to the presidency upon the sudden and unexpected death of President Taylor in July 1850. The change in leadership also signaled an abrupt political shift as Fillmore appointed his own cabinet. Taylor, himself, had been about to replace his entire scandal-ridden cabinet at the time of his death, but now, beginning with the appointment of Daniel Webster as Secretary of State, Fillmore's cabinet would be dominated by individuals who, with the exception of Treasury Secretary Thomas Corwin, favored what would come to be called the Compromise of 1850.</p>   <p>As president, Fillmore dealt with increasing party divisions within the Whig party; party harmony became one of his primary objectives. He tried to unite the party by pointing out the differences between the Whigs and the Democrats (by proposing tariff reforms that negatively reflected on the Democratic Party). Another primary objective of Fillmore was to preserve the Union from the intensifying slavery debate.</p>   <p>Most of Fillmore's correspondence was destroyed in pursuance of a direction in his son's will.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He grew up on subsistence farms in Vermont and Rhode Island, became an apprentice first as a machinist, then as a draftsman, before training as a mechanical engineer. He spent five years in New York City as an editor for a machine tool magazine. After moving to Vermont, he managed and then became president of a successful machine tool company. Flanders used his experience as an industrialist to advise state and national commissions in Vermont, New England and Washington, D.C. on public economic policy. He was president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank for two years before being elected U.S. Senator from Vermont.    </p> <p>Flanders was an early and strong critic of fellow Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy's ""misdirection of our efforts at fighting communism"" and his role in ""the loss of respect for us in the world at large."" He felt that rather than looking inward for communists within U.S. borders, the nation should look outward at the ""alarming world-wide advance of Communist power"" that would leave the United States and Canada as ""the last remnants of the free world."" On March 9, 1954 he addressed Senator McCarthy on the Senate floor, expressing these concerns. (McCarthy had been advised of the speech, but was absent at the time.) Apart from a brief note of encouragement after this speech, Flanders was grateful that the president stayed out of the McCarthy controversy. Members of President Eisenhower's cabinet passed along the message that Flanders should ""lay off.""</p>   <p>On June 11, 1954, Flanders introduced a resolution charging McCarthy ""with unbecoming conduct and calling for his removal from his committee membership."" Upon the advice of Senators Cooper and Fulbright and legal assistance from the Committee for a More Effective Congress he modified his resolution to ""bring it in line with previous actions of censure."" The text of the resolution of censure condemns the senator for ""obstructing the constitutional processes of the Senate"" when he ""failed to cooperate with the Subcommittee on Privileges and Elections of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration and acting ""contrary to senatorial ethics"" when he described the Select Committee to Study Censure Charges and its chairman in slanderous terms. <em>Time</em> Magazine reported that a ""group of 23 top businessmen, labor leaders and educators... wired every U.S. Senator (except McCarthy himself) urging a favorable vote âto curb the flagrant abuse of power by Senator McCarthy.'"" The Senate censured McCarthy in December 2, 1954 by a vote of 65 to 22. The Senate Republicans were split 22 to 22.</p>   <p>Flanders was the author or coauthor of eight books, including his autobiography, Senator from Vermont. He wrote about many issues: the problems of unemployment, inflation, ways for achieving a cooperative relationship between management and labor, and his belief that ""moral law is natural law"" and should be an integral part of everyone's education. His papers are located at the Special Collections Research Center at Syracuse University Library and at the Special Collections of the University of Vermont's Bailey-Howe Library.</p>   <p>During his lifetime, Flanders received more than sixteen honorary degrees from institutions that included Dartmouth College, Harvard University (LL.D.), Middlebury College (D. Sc.) and the University of Vermont (D. Eng.). His wife, Helen Hartness Flanders, was a folk song collector and author of several books on New England ballads.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Garfield attacked political corruption and won back for the Presidency a measure of prestige it had lost during the Reconstruction period. During the Civil War in 1862, when Union military victories had been few, he successfully led a brigade at Middle Creek, Kentucky, against Confederate troops.

David was so inspired by Gore's slide show that she, with Lawrence Bender, met with Guggenheim to adapt the presentation into a film.</p> <p>Since the film's release, <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> has been credited for raising international public awareness of climate change and reenergizing the environmental movement. The film opened in New York City and Los Angeles on May 24, 2006. At the 2006 Sundance Film Festival, the movie received three standing ovations. It was also screened at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was the opening night film at the 27th Durban International Film Festival on June 14, 2006. <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em> was the most popular documentary at the 2006 Brisbane International Film Festival.</p> <p>The film has grossed over $24 million in the U.S. and over $49 million worldwide, making it the sixth-highest-grossing documentary in the U.S. to date, (from 1982 to the present). According to Gore, ""Tipper and I are devoting 100 percent of the profits from the book and the movie to a new bipartisan educational campaign to further spread the message about global warming."" Paramount Classics committed 5% of their domestic theatrical gross from the film to form a new bipartisan climate action group, Alliance for Climate Protection, dedicated to awareness and grassroots organizing.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Parsons.""</em></p></blockquote> <p style=""text-align: center"">Â <img alt=""Louella Parsons"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_59795721-1517-6111-28261692C050C62B.jpg"" title=""Louella Parsons"" width=""293""/></p> <p><strong>LOUELLA PARSONS</strong> (1881-1972) was an American gossip columnist who had her own radio show which featured interviews with Hollywood celebrities.  </p> <strong></strong>   <p>In 1914, Parsons began writing the first gossip column in the United States for the <em>Chicago Record-Herald</em>. <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/william-randolph-hearst-signed-signature-autographed-photo-hearst-castle-san-simeon"">William Randolph Hearst</a> bought that newspaper in 1918 and Parsons was out of a job, as Hearst had not yet discovered that movies and movie personalities were news. Parsons then moved to New York and started working for the <em>New York Morning Telegraph</em> writing a similar movie column, which attracted the attention of Hearst. In 1922, after some shrewd bargaining on both sides, she signed a contract and joined the Hearst newspaper the <em>New York American</em>.</p>   <p>In 1925, Parsons contracted tuberculosis and was told she had six months to live. She moved to Arizona for the change in climate, then to Los Angeles, where she decided to stay. With the disease in remission, she went back to work, becoming a syndicated Hollywood columnist for Hearst. As she and the publishing mogul had developed an ironclad relationship, her <em>Los Angeles Examiner</em> column came to appear in over six hundred newspapers the world over, with a readership of more than twenty-million, and Parsons gradually became one of the most powerful voices in the movie business with her daily allotment of gossip. According to Hearst's mistress and protegÃ© Marion Davies in her posthumously published memoirs <em>The Times We Had</em>, Parsons had encouraged readers to ""give this girl a chance"" while the majority of critics disparaged Davies; it was on this basis that Hearst hired Parsons.</p>   <p>Beginning in 1928, she hosted a weekly radio program featuring movie star interviews that was sponsored by SunKist. A similar program in 1931 was sponsored by Charis Foundation Garment. In 1934, she signed a contract with the Campbell's Soup Company and began hosting a program titled <em>Hollywood Hotel</em>, which showcased stars in scenes from their upcoming movies.</p>   <p>Parsons was especially known for her uncanny ability to scoop her competitors with the juiciest stories and for knowing all the secrets of everyone in screendom. She was associated with various Hearst enterprises for the rest of her career. Parsons established herself as the social and moral arbiter of Hollywood. Her judgments were considered the final word in most cases, and her disfavor was feared more than that of movie critics. Her column was followed religiously and thus afforded her a unique type and degree of power. Her formidable power remained unchallenged until 1937, when Hedda Hopper, a struggling character actress since the days of silent movies, whom Parsons had been kind to and mentioned occasionally in her column, and who had returned the favor by giving Parsons information on others, was hired to be a gossip columnist by one of Hearst's rival newspapers. Parsons and Hopper then became arch-rivals and had a notorious feud.</p>   <p>Parsons also appeared in numerous cameo spots in movies, including <em>Hollywood Hotel</em> (1937), <em>Without Reservations</em> (1946) and <em>Starlift</em> (1951). She was caricatured in Frank Tashlin's 1937 cartoon <em>The Woods are Full of Cuckoos</em> as ""Louella Possums"".</p>   <p>In 1944, she wrote her memoirs, <em>The Gay Illiterate</em>, published by Doubleday, Doran and Company, which became a bestseller. That was followed by another volume in 1961, <em>Tell It To Louella</em>, published by G.P. Putnam's Sons.</p>  ",1944,100,0,FALSE,3375,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/5970277A-1517-6111-281727D134C04A3B.jpg,

Rudy Truesdale, San Luis Obispo, California. Slight tear in upper right, otherwise in very good condition. Inscribed and signed by W.R. Hearst, in full:</strong></p>   <blockquote><p><strong><em>""Dear Clarence:Â  Here is a view of the ""Hill Top"" as it looks to you as you circle around in your plane, on the too rare and too short visits that you make us. Hoping to see you soon again - W.R. Hearst""</em></strong></p></blockquote>   <p>In researching the provenance of this photograph, we found three prominent ""Clarence's"" in Hearst's life: <strong>Clarence Darrow</strong>, Hearst's general counsel, who was also the famed defense attorney in the 1925 Scopes ""Monkey"" Trial; <strong>Clarence Lindner</strong>, editor of Hearst's <em>San Francisco Examiner</em>; and <strong>Clarence Shearn</strong>, another Hearst attorney. Though it's possible it was another Clarence altogether, it was quite probably one of the three just mentioned; whoever it was had his own plane when visiting Hearst Castle, which had its own private landing strip.</p>   <p><strong>Hearst Castle</strong> is the palatial estate built by Hearst over a period of 28 years, from 1919 to 1947, designed by San Francisco architect Julia Morgan. It is located near San Simeon, California, on a stunning hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. Donated by the Hearst Corporation to the state of California in 1957, it is now a State Historical Monument and a National Historic Landmark, open for public tours. Hearst formally named the estate <em>La Cuesta Encantada</em> (""The Enchanted Hill""), but he usually just called it ""the Ranch"". The castle and grounds are also sometimes referred to as ""San Simeon,"" for the nearby town.</p>   <p>The mammoth estate is a pastiche of historic architectural styles that Hearst admired in his travels around Europe. For example, the main house is modeled after a 16th century Spanish cathedral, while the outdoor swimming pool features an ancient Roman temple front transported wholesale from Europe and reconstructed at the site. Hearst furnished the estate with truckloads of art, antiques, and even whole ceilings that he acquired in their entirety from Europe and Egypt.</p>   <p>Comprising over 90,000 square feet, Hearst Castle features 56 bedrooms, 61 bathrooms, 19 sitting rooms, 127 acres of gardens, indoor and outdoor swimming pools, tennis courts, a movie theater, an airfield, and, at the time, the world's largest private zoo. Zebras and other exotic animals still roam the grounds. </p>   <p>Invitations to Hearst Castle were highly coveted during its heyday in the 1920s and '30s. The Hollywood and political elite often visited, usually flying into the estate's airfield or taking a private Hearst-owned train car from Los Angeles. Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, the Marx Brothers, Charles Lindbergh, Joan Crawford, Calvin Coolidge, William P. Clark, Franklin Roosevelt, and Winston Churchill were among Hearst's A-list guests. While guests were expected to attend the formal dinners each evening, they were normally left to their own devices during the day while Hearst directed his business affairs. Since ""the Ranch"" had so many facilities, guests were rarely at a loss for things to do. The estate's theater usually screened films from Hearst's own movie studio, Cosmopolitan Productions. Hearst Castle became so famous that it was caricatured in the 1941 Orson Welles film <em>Citizen Kane</em> as Charles Foster Kane's ""Xanadu.""</p> <p>This informative and <a href=""http://www.hearstcastle.org/legacy/history/facts_stats.cfm"" target=""_blank"">full-color map of Hearst Castle </a>can be useful in identifying some of the buildings in the photograph. </p>   <p><strong>WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST I</strong> (1863 -1951) was an American newspaper magnate and leading newspaper publisher. The son of self-made millionaire George Hearst, he became aware that his father received a northern California newspaper, <em>The San Francisco Examiner</em>, as payment of a gambling debt. Still a student at Harvard, he asked his father to give him the newspaper to run. In 1887, he became the paper's publisher and devoted long hours and much money to making it a success. Crusading for civic improvement and exposing municipal corruption, he greatly increased the paper's circulation. He was twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Edgar Hoover's sexuality. On FBI letterhead dated September 22, 1971, the otherwise routine letter describes many of Hoover's personal interests. Strikingly framed with a photograph of Hoover with his assistant and alleged lover Clyde Tolson watching the famed Joe Louis-Jack Sharkey boxing match of August 18, 1936 with unusual interest.</strong></p> <p><strong>John Edgar Hoover</strong> (1895-1972) was the first Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States. Appointed director of the Bureau of Investigation-predecessor to the FBI-in 1924, he was instrumental in founding the FBI in 1935, where he remained director until his death in 1972. Hoover is credited with building the FBI into a large and efficient crime-fighting agency, and with instituting a number of modern innovations to police technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories. Hoover posthumously became an increasingly controversial figure. Some critics asserted that he exceeded the jurisdiction of the FBI. He used the FBI to harass political dissenters and activists, to amass secret files on political leaders, and to use illegal methods to collect evidence. It is because of Hoover's long and controversial reign that FBI directors are now limited to 10-year terms.  </p> <strong></strong>   <p>Hoover was a lifelong bachelor, and since at least the 1940s unsubstantiated rumors have circulated that he was homosexual. It has also been suggested that Clyde Tolson, an associate director of the FBI who was Hoover's heir, may also have been his lover.</p>   <p>Some authors have dismissed the rumors about Hoover's sexuality and his relationship with Tolson in particular as unlikely, while others have described them as probable or even ""confirmed"", and still others have reported the rumors without stating an opinion. Hoover described Tolson as his alter ego: the men not only worked closely together during the day, but also took meals, went to nightclubs and vacationed together. The exceedingly close relationship between the two is often cited as evidence that the two were lovers, though some FBI employees who knew them, such as Mark Felt, say that the relationship was merely ""brotherly"".</p>   <p>Tolson inherited Hoover's estate and moved into his home, having also accepted the American flag that draped Hoover's casket. Tolson is buried a few yards away from Hoover in the Congressional Cemetery. Attorney Roy Cohn, an associate of Hoover during the 1950s investigations of Communists and himself a closeted homosexual, opined that Hoover was too frightened of his own sexuality to have anything approaching a normal sexual or romantic relationship.</p>   <p>Those who discount the gay rumors about Hoover have pointed out that his concern for public appearances and his reluctance to have the image of the FBI tarnished, as well as his essentially being a careerist whose primary focus was on his work, would have prevented him from forming any long-range romantic attachments.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

As a result it inspired a revival of the old-fashioned rocking chair in homes across America, and what would become a lasting symbol of John Kennedy and his presidency. </p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>The letter reads:</p>   <blockquote><p><em><strong>November 20, 1963</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Dear Dr. Travell,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>A very dear friend of mine in New York is having a little heart trouble and would like to get hold of a good doctor there.

Johnson being sworn in, following the assassination of President John Kennedy. </strong>Above his original signature Stoughton has also printed the date and place of JFK's assassination and Johnson's oath of office aboard Air Force One. To the left of Johnson is Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of Kennedy (still wearing her blood-splattered dress); to his right is Lady Bird Johnson, and sitting down near the airplane window is Jack Valenti, an aide to Johnson who later was president of the Motion Picture Association of America.<br/><br/><strong>CECIL W. STOUGHTON</strong> (1920-2008) was an American photographer. Stoughton, a captain in the United States Army Signal Corp, was assigned to the White House Army Signal Agency, and is best known for being President John F. Kennedy's photographer during his White House years. Stoughton's behind-the-scene pictures of John and Jacqueline and their children in their public and personal life were pivotal in shaping the public's view of the U.S. first family. He took over eight thousand pictures of the family spanning the 34-month period beginning with Kennedy's inauguration and ending with his assassination.<br/><br/>Stoughton was present at the motorcade at which Kennedy was assassinated, and was subsequently the only photographer on board Air Force One when Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the next President. Stoughton's famous photograph of this event depicts Johnson raising his hand in oath as he stood between his wife Lady Bird Johnson and a still blood-spattered Jacqueline Kennedy. Stoughton also served as White House photographer during Johnson's first two years in office, and recounted this service in an oral history contributed to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.</p> <p>In the immediate chaotic aftermath of the assassination, Stoughton  learned that Johnson was being sworn in on the aircraft on a Dallas  airfield and rushed over in a car. As he was running across  the tarmac, the Secret Service thought it was another assassination  attempt and almost fired at him. As reported at the time, Stoughton's  camera jammed just as Johnson was about to be sworn in but he gave it a  good shake and it starting working again.</p> <p>Though the program was taped in June 2008, Stoughton was featured on the television series <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200702A13.html"" target=""_blank"">Antiques Roadshow</a> when it aired on November 3, 2008âcoincidentally, the day of his deathârecounting his story and presenting prints of his photographs from his personal collection, including a print of this photograph of Johnson being sworn in that the President had signed to Stoughton. A partial transcript of the story in his own words:</p> <blockquote>""I was in Dallas during the horrible assassination. I was in one of the cars in the motorcade five cars back. Heard three very distinct reports, sounded like rifle shots. Didn't know where they came from. A few minutes later, I was on my way to the Air Force One. I had seen vice president Johnson leaving the hospital and I asked where he was going and someone said, âThe president's going to Washington.' So that meant that Kennedy had expired in the hospital, where I was standing outside the operating room door there. And I said, âSo am I.' And I picked up my camera and went out to the plane. And when I got there, the press secretary, acting press secretary, Malcolm Kilduff, said, âThank God you're here, Cecil.' He said, âThe president's going to take his oath on the plane and you're going to have to service the wires with the photograph.' So I took the only photograph of the swearing-in that you see.""Hailed by National Geographic and many others as ""perhaps the most famous-and most important-image ever taken by a presidential photographer.""</blockquote> Â  <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Jones was a strong advocate of the civil rights movement and opposed the Vietnam War, preaching about such issues regularly. It was voices like the Rev.

Though Kennedy did make an effort, strict immigration quotas at the time had already been met, and not even a sitting U.S. Senator could effect a change in the law.</p> <p>Throughout his presidency, John F. Kennedy was passionate about the issue of immigration reform. He believed that America is a nation of people who value both tradition and the exploration of new frontiers, people who deserve the freedom to build better lives for themselves in their adopted homeland.

It comes to us from the estate of noted New England architect, William Roger Greeley, a contemporary of Frank Lloyd Wright. </strong>A clipping from a newsletter published two days prior announces Congressman Kennedy (""Just returned from Europe and the Far East"") as guest speaker for the Massachusetts Building Congress Annual Dinner Meeting on January 10, 1952. Congressman Kennedy was quick to follow-up the next day, likely implying Mr. Greeley and friends were big campaign donors.</p>   <p><strong>JOHN F. KENNEDY</strong> (1917-1963). U.S. President, Senator and Member of the House of Representatives. Of Irish descent, John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety. </p>   <p>Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing in 1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history. </p>   <p>In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the first Roman Catholic President. </p>   <p>His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: ""Ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country."" As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and poverty. </p> <p>Â </p>   <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Kennedy writes to Homer Facto, one of his crewmen on PT-59, the Navy vessel Kennedy commanded after the sinking of PT-109. Personally signed, not secretarial or Autopen. JFK adds a personal note in his own hand at end of letter. Horizontal fold in center, very light toning on the sides at the fold, otherwise in fine condition. </p> <p>The letter reads:</p>   <blockquote><p><strong>January 7, 1955</strong></p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p><strong>Mr. Homer Facto<br/>Au Sable Forks<br/>New York, NY</strong></p><p><strong>Dear <strike>Mr. Facto</strike>:</strong> <em>(personalizing it, JFK strikes out the name, writing ""Homer"" over it)</em></p><p><strong>Many, many thanks for your kind message to me when I was in the hospital in New York. Hospitals are gloomy places, I am afraid; and it makes a tremendous difference when friends remember you as you did.</strong></p><p><strong>I am feeling much better and am looking forward to getting back to Washington around the first of March. Perhaps then I will have a chance to thank you again in person.</strong></p><p><strong>Until then, Jackie and I want to wish you and all your family a very happy and successful New Year.</strong></p><p><strong>Sincerely,<br/>John Kennedy</strong></p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p><em>(JFK also adds a personal handwritten note): </em><strong>I was very glad to hear from you Homer. Hope all goes well.</strong><br/> </p></blockquote>   <h3><strong>About JFK When He Wrote This Letter</strong></h3>   <p>Kennedy was plagued much of his life by back problems. He had ruptured the same disc in his spine twice, once while playing college football, and again in World War II when, in the early hours of August 2, 1943, the Japanese destroyer <em>Amagiri</em> rammed PT-109 at sea, and JFK was slammed against the steel support of the cabin. </p>   <p>As she gradually sank during the day her eleven survivors abandoned ship, swimming to tiny Plum Pudding Island some miles away. Then a lieutenant (junior grade) in command of the vessel, Kennedy saved the life of his severely injured machinist Patrick McMahon by putting the strap of his life jacket in his teeth and towing him to safety. It took the rest of the crew five hours to reach Plum Pudding Island on a piece of wooden debris from the boat.</p>   <p>Owing to the physical demands he had endured in college and during the war, from a medical perspective Kennedy was a wreck. He was hospitalized more than three dozen times in his life, and received the last rites of his Roman Catholic faith no less than three times. Three months before writing this letter, in October 1954, JFK was admitted to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York for back surgery. His post-operative healing was problematic, and he was not discharged from the hospital until December of that year.</p>   <p>This letter to Homer Facto, dated January 7, 1955, was written just weeks after Kennedy returned home to recuperate, and is a perfect example of how much JFK liked to stay in touch with his old PT-crew members over the years. During the same time he wrote this letter, Kennedy was working on <em>Profiles in Courage,</em> the book that would eventually win him the Pulitzer Prize in History.</p>   <h3><strong>What This Historical Letter Reveals about JFK</strong></h3>   <p>As was the case with the Motor Patrol Torpedo Boat 109, PT-59 was out of commission when JFK took command, it being converted into an experimental gunboat to be used as a weapon against enemy barges. The transformation involved removing the four torpedo tubes and replacing them with additional machine guns behind armor shields. </p>   <p>JFK's PT-59 crew had five of the old PT-109 crew members, namely: Maquire, Mauer, Kowal, Drewitch and Drawdy. His new PT-59 crew were: Helmer, Christianson, Cline, Alexander, Servatius, Slagle, Scribner, Srickland and <strong>Homer Facto</strong>. As the boat's machinist, it is highly probable that Facto was instrumental in converting PT-59 for its new skipper, now full Lieutenant John F. Kennedy.</p>   <p>In the best-selling book <em>Johnny, We Hardly Knew Ye</em>, JFK's friends and advisors Kenneth O'Donnell and David Powers give us a wonderful insight into how grateful Kennedy was about letters of that time:</p>   <blockquote><p><strong>We remember the President one day in November showing us a letter from a retired Marine Corps colonel, W. T. Bigger of McLean, Virginia. Kennedy was obviously moved and pleased to receive the letter, although he tried to be casual about it. ""This is a little incident in my Navy career that wasn't written up in the <em>Reader's Digest</em>,"" he said.</strong></p><p><strong>Colonel Bigger's letter, dated November 2, 1963, reminded the President that 20 years earlier, on the same date on 1943, Kennedy had taken his boat under heavy enemy fire to a beach on the Choiseul River where Bigger's Marine riflemen were surrounded by the Japanese with their backs to the water.</strong></p><p><strong>""When all seemed lost,"" the Marine officer wrote to the President, ""you can well appreciate my relief to see the landing craft returning, escorted by PT boats, one commanded by you."" The landing craft lost its power, but Kennedy rescued the Marines in his boat and brought them safely back to their base. ""As I recall, we both had our hands full and there was little time for amenities. Please accept again my heartfelt thanks,"" the colonel wrote in his letter of twenty years later.</strong></p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p><strong>""Wasn't it nice of him to go to the trouble of writing that letter to me?"" the President said to us.</strong></p></blockquote>   <p>Just twenty days later, on November 22, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas.</p> <h3>About the Display </h3> <p>Befitting its value and historical significance, this letter has been professionally framed using the finest museum conservation-quality standards. Measuring 17â x 21â and featuring a fine engraving of JFK, each window is bordered with handmade Italian marbled paper in a blue and cream peacock motif. The top mat is lined in a deep presidential blue fabric (though it appears darker in photos), and the whole presentation comes together in an exquisitely carved, gilded cream felt-bordered wooden frame with the highest-quality museum glass. A brass plaque indicating the Presidentâs name, lifespan dates, and his last title completes the ensemble.<br/><br/>If kept out of direct sunlight and maintained in a clean, temperate environment, this historic presentation will provide a lasting tribute to the memory and achievements of President Kennedy for generations. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

She knew Dr. Travell wellâshe had been caring for Jack Kennedy's war-related back problems since he was a U.S. Senator. Indeed, it was Janet Travell who recommended that Kennedy use a rocking chair to help alleviate his lower back pain by keeping the muscles in motion, contracting and relaxing. As a result it inspired a revival of the old-fashioned rocking chair in homes across America, and what would become a lasting symbol of John Kennedy and his presidency. </p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>The letter reads:</p>   <blockquote><p><em><strong>November 20, 1963</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Dear Dr. Travell,</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>A very dear friend of mine in New York is having a little heart trouble and would like to get hold of a good doctor there.

Kennedy was killed by an assassin in Dallas, Texas. This is believed to be one of the last letters to emerge from the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port in 1963 using social stationery with a white border. Following that fateful day in November, Rose Kennedy and her clan would write the painful thank you letters to friends and family with traditional black-bordered mourning stationery.</p> <p>As it happens, aside from being JFK's personal physicianâthe first female in history to hold that position to a serving U.S. presidentâJanet Travell is famous in her own right as a leading pioneer in the diagnosis and treatment of myofascial pain syndrome secondary to trigger points.

Rives, to an Indian Agency post. </strong></p>   <h3><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>   <p>Long believed non-extant, this recently found letter was discovered in an attic in Providence, Rhode Island, during inventory for an estate sale by a local antique dealer, Frederick Schroeder of Armory Antiques in Newport, RI. Both the <a href=""http://www.papersofabrahamlincoln.org/"" target=""_blank"">Abraham Lincoln Papers Project</a> of Springfield, Ill., and the <a href=""http://www.rosenbach.org/"" target=""_blank"">Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library</a> in Philadelphia, now aware of the letter's existence, requested and were sent scanned images for their archives. This letter completes the provenance of a pre-existing letter in the Rosenbach Collection, in which Lincoln writes to George W. Rives regarding a letter of recommendation Rives has requested. </p>   <p>As officially published in the January-March 2008 newsletter of <a href=""http://www.papersofabrahamlincoln.org/NewsletterPDFs/EDITOR27.pdf"" target=""_blank"">The Papers of Abraham Lincoln</a>:</p>   <blockquote><h3><strong>Lincoln's Reluctant Recommendation</strong></h3></blockquote>   <blockquote><p>The editors of the Papers of Abraham Lincoln periodically check online auctions for new documents that fall within the project's scope.  Occasionally, we find surprising new documents in unlikely places.  In February, a new document appeared on eBay from a private seller in Providence, Rhode Island.  According to the listing, the seller found the letter in a bundle of others in an attic in Newport.  After failing to contact the seller, we were able to contact the winning bidder, [Vintage Memorabilia] in Seattle, Washington, [who] graciously provided the project with a high-resolution color image of the document...</p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p>The document is interesting for several reasons.  First, it is a relatively early Lincoln letter, written in December 1849, after Lincoln had finished his one lackluster term in Congress.  Second, it is a long-lost enclosure to a known Lincoln letter.  Third, it demonstrates both Lincoln's magnanimity in agreeing to provide a recommendation for someone whom he believed had openly criticized him and Lincoln's caution in the rather muted letter of support.</p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p>On April 25, 1849, George W. Rives wrote to ex-Congressman Abraham Lincoln, asking for his assistance in obtaining an appointment as an Indian agent in Minnesota.  Rives was a 34-year-old farmer living in Paris, the county seat of Edgar County in east-central Illinois bordering Indiana.<strong>  Lincoln </strong>responded on May 7 that Rives overrated Lincoln's ""capacity to serve you. Not one man recommended by me has yet been appointed to any thing, little or big, except a few who had no opposition.""  Since President Zachary Taylor's inauguration in March, Lincoln had been trying to get an appointment for Anson G. Henry in Minnesota, without success.  He declined to risk Henry's chances by supporting another candidate for a position in Minnesota.</p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p>During May and June of 1849, Lincoln actively campaigned to become the Commissioner of the General Land Office and asked many friends for their support.  His primary opponent was Chicago attorney Justin Butterfield of Chicago.  The contest between Lincoln and Butterfield revealed and exacerbated divisions among Illinois Whigs, and Rives may have supported Butterfield.  President Taylor appointed Butterfield to the post, and Lincoln was disappointed personally and worried that the appointment would undermine the Whigs in Illinois.</p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p>On November 7, Rives wrote to Lincoln asking for a letter of recommendation.  Lincoln hesitated before replying, then sent the following letter on December 15.</p></blockquote>   <p><strong>                                                              Springfield, Decr. 15, 1849</strong></p>   <blockquote><p><strong>G.

From the beginning of our acquaintance I had felt the greatest kindness for you, and had supposed it was reciprocated on your part. Last summer, under circumstances which I mentioned to you, I was painfully constrained to withhold a recommendation which you desired; and shortly afterwards I learned, in such way as to believe it, that you were indulging open abuse of me. Of course my feelings were wounded. On receiving your last letter, the question occurred whether you were attempting to use me, at the same time you would injure me, or whether you might not have been misrepresented to me. If the former, I ought not to answer you; if the latter I ought, and so I have remained in suspense. I now enclose you a letter which you may use if you think fit. </strong></p><p><strong>                                                       Yours &amp;c.<br/>                                                       A.

Basler and his colleagues included this letter in The Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln, published in 1953, and noted that the letter of recommendation that Lincoln mentions in the last sentence was ""presumably not extant."" This long-lost letter is the one that appeared on eBay in February.</p><p>The text of Lincoln's letter of recommendation, written to Secretary of the Interior Thomas Ewing, is as follows.</p></blockquote>   <p><strong>                                                        Springfield Ills.

[Vintage Memorabilia] sent the project a scan of Lincoln's letter to Ewing in March of this year.  Now, after more than a century and a half of separation, the two letters that Lincoln sent to Rives, one now in Philadelphia and the other in Seattle, are reunited virtually in the Papers of Abraham Lincoln.</p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p>George W. Rives was an active supporter of Lincoln's bid for the United States Senate in 1858.  After the election of a majority of Democratic representatives to the state legislature in November, Rives wrote to Lincoln a ""word of consolation &amp; comfort.""  Rives was proud that Republicans did their ""whole duty"" in Edgar County by electing Republicans to the state legislature.  Rives concluded his letter by assuring Lincoln that ""we stand ready to aid you in 1860.  We are for You first &amp; last. . . .  No man never had Such friends in Edgar as you have! Can we do you any Good[,] Command us &amp; we will obey.  We await your Command.""  Rives also worked for Lincoln's election to the Presidency in 1860.  On August 28, 1862, Lincoln appointed Rives as the Assessor of Taxes for the Seventh Collection District of Illinois.</p></blockquote>   <p>The document is in extraordinarily fine condition, having been protected in an envelope for some 140 years. As can be seen, the color, tone, London stationer's embossing, and overall appearance are fresh and immaculate (notably so, as compared with the Rosenbach letter).</p> <p>Â </p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a tremendously broad career as a writer that also included a period as an influential literary critic. Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir Patrick Geddes. Mumford was also a contemporary and friend of <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/frank-lloyd-wright-signed-letter-jj-polivka-signature-autographed-1952"">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, Frederic J. Osborn, Edmund N. Bacon, and Vannevar Bush.</p>   <p>Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex. He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information ""pooling"" in the world as humanity moved into the future.</p>   <p>Mumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. <em>The Golden Day</em> contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850's American transcendentalist authors and <em>Herman Melville: A study of His Life and Vision</em> effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of Herman Melville. Soon after, with the book <em>The Brown Decades</em>, he began to establish himself as an authority in US architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.</p>   <p>In his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and mass communication to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of Henry Hobson Richardson, Louis Sullivan and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/frank-lloyd-wright-signed-letter-jj-polivka-signature-autographed-1952"">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

On November 17,  1973, at a televised question and answer session with the press, Nixon said,  <em>""People have got to know  whether or not their President is a crook. Well, I'm not a crook. I've earned  everything I've got.""</em></p>   <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">The House  Judiciary Committee controlled by Democrats opened formal and public impeachment  hearings against Nixon on May 9, 1974. Despite his efforts, one of the secret  recordings, known as the ""smoking gun"" tape, was released on August 5, 1974, and  revealed that Nixon authorized hush money to Watergate burglar E. Howard Hunt,  and also revealed that Nixon ordered the CIA to tell the FBI to stop  investigating certain topics because of ""the Bay of Pigs thing."" In light of his  loss of political support and the near certainty of both his impeachment by the  House of Representatives and his probable conviction by the Senate, he resigned  on August 9,  1974, after addressing the nation on television the previous  evening. He never admitted to criminal wrongdoing, although he later conceded  errors of judgment.Â  </p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">On September 8,  1974, a blanket pardon from President Ford, who served as Nixon's second Vice  President, ended any possibility of indictment. The pardon was highly  controversial and Nixon's critics claimed that the blanket pardon was quid pro  quo for his resignation. No evidence of this ""corrupt bargain"" has ever been  proven, and many modern historians dismiss any claims of overt collusion between  the two men concerning the pardon.</p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">These authentically-signed souvenir resignation letters are hard to find, and represent a pivotal point in American history. </p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1""><title></title><link href=""/FCKeditor2.3/editor/css/fck_editorarea.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""/><link _fcktemp=""true"" href=""http://67.199.77.192/mcms_admin/css/fck_internal.css"" rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css""/><style _fcktemp=""true"" type=""text/css"">INPUT { behavior: url(http://www.auctiva.com/FCKeditor2.3/editor/css/behaviors/hiddenfield.htc) ; }TABLE { behavior: url(http://www.auctiva.com/FCKeditor2.3/editor/css/behaviors/showtableborders.htc) ; }INPUT,TEXTAREA,SELECT,.FCK__Anchor,.FCK__PageBreak { behavior: url(http://www.auctiva.com/FCKeditor2.3/editor/css/behaviors/disablehandles.htc) ; }</style></p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">Befitting its value and historical  significance, this letter has been professionally framed using the finest  archival conservation-quality standards.

He served as Ambassador to the United Nations from 1961 to 1965.</p>   <p>Adlai Stevenson's impact is long-lived in popular culture.

Most notably, Peter Sellers claimed that his portrayal of President Merkin Muffley in <em>Dr. Strangelove</em> was modeled on Stevenson. Stevenson's legendary ""Don't wait for the translation"" speech to Russian ambassador Valerian Zorin during the Cuban Missile Crisis inspired dialogue in a courtroom scene in <em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em>. The historical speech itself is depicted in the 2000 film <em>Thirteen Days</em>.

In foreign policy he shifted from pro-Soviet in the 1940s to anti-Communist in the 1950s. He represented Florida in the United States Senate from 1936 to 1951, and the Miami area in the United States House of Representatives from 1963 to 1989.  </p>   <p>Pepper lost in the Democratic primary for the United States Senate in 1934, but won in a 1936 special election following the death of Senator Duncan Fletcher. In the Senate, Pepper became a leading New Dealer and close ally of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He was unusually articulate and intellectual, and, collaborating with labor unions, he was often the leader of the liberal-left forces in the Senate. His reelection in a heavily fought primary in 1938 solidified his reputation as the most prominent liberal in Congress. He was re-elected in 1944, but lost his bid for a third full term in 1950 by a margin of over 60,000 votes. </p>   <p>In 1962 Pepper was elected to the United States House of Representatives from a liberal district around Miami and Miami Beach, becoming one of very few former United States Senators in modern times (the only other example being James Wolcott Wadsworth Jr.) to be elected to the House after their Senate careers. He remained there until his death in 1989, rising to chair of the powerful Rules Committee in 1983. At this stage Pepper was staunchly anti-Communist and anti-Castro; he supported aid to the Nicaraguan ""Contra"" rebels.</p>   <p>In the early 1970s, Pepper chaired the Joint House-Senate Committee on Crime; then, in 1977, he became chair of the new House Select Committee on Aging, which became his base as he emerged as the nation's foremost spokesman for the elderly, especially regarding Social Security programs. He succeeded in strengthening the Medicare. In the 1980s he worked with Alan Greenspan in a major reform of the Social Security system that maintained its solvency by slowly raising the retirement age, thus cutting benefits for workers retiring in their mid-60s, and in 1986 he obtained the passage of a federal law that abolished most mandatory retirement ages.</p>   <p>Pepper served in Congress longer than any other Floridian and became known as the ""grand old man of Florida politics"". He was featured on the cover of <em>Time</em> Magazine in 1938 and 1983. Republicans often joked that he and Tip O'Neill were the only Democrats who really drove President Reagan crazy. When he died, his body lay in state for two days under the Rotunda of the United States Capitol; he was the 26th American so honored.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Roosevelt, Franklin D.,Roosevelt,U.S. Presidential & Political,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/franklin-roosevelt-autograph-letter-signed-raymond-baker/,ALS to Director of the US Mint Ray Baker,"  <p>Autograph Letter Signed in the bold hand of Roosevelt himself, written in black ink with a fountain pen. It conveys a caring sentiment FDR sent to an old friend and colleague, Raymond T. Baker, who the president had appointed Director of the United States Mint in 1917. Baker had suffered a heart attack in 1935, and upon hearing the news FDR sent this note on March 19, writing:</p>   <blockquote><p><strong>Dear Ray -</strong></p><p><strong>I was distressed to hear of your illness. Do what the doctors say &amp; get on your feet again quickly - My affectionate regards</strong></p><p><strong>As ever yours<br/>Franklin D Roosevelt</strong></p></blockquote> <p>Handwritten letters of FDR have always been scarce. This letter, with its intimate and interesting association, is a superb piece for any serious Roosevelt or presidential collector. The letter has a single mailing fold and is in excellent condition. </p>   <h3><strong>Who was Ray Baker?</strong></h3>   <p>Born in 1877, Raymond T. Baker had a remarkably vibrant life. Over the span of 55 years he was at various times a cattle puncher, a stage actor, a Stanford graduate, a copper miner and a gold prospector, a prison warden, a bond investor, first secretary to the Russian Ambassador, a lobbyist for the shipping industry, a candidate for the US Senateâand was the first mining prospector to be named Mint Director.</p>   <p>On June 12, 1918, Ray Baker married Margaret Vanderbilt, whose former husband, Alfredâsportsman, millionaire, and patriarch of the Vanderbilt familyâlost his life when the <em>RMS Lusitania</em> sank in 1915. As author John Grissim wrote, ""...The press had a field dayâhandsome Nevada miner and adventurer now running the U.S. Mint marries the most beautiful and altogether richest woman in America (she was worth a tidy $50 million)....""</p>   <p>But after ten years that marriage ended in divorce, and Ray married automobile heiress Delphine Dodge, the only daughter of Horace Dodge, one of the two co-founders of the Dodge Motor Company.</p>   <p>Clearly Raymond Baker was, as his great nephew writes, ""...a man who thrived on the adventure of the here and now, who earned and freely spent several small fortunes, and who took much satisfaction when no less a personage than Franklin Roosevelt one evening at an intimate White House dinner introduced Ray Baker as ""the golden boy from the Silver State.""</p>   <p>Baker died three months after suffering the heart attack that prompted this letter from the president, which comes to us from Mr. Baker's great nephew, the writer John Grissim, who provides a solid and entertaining written provenance for FDR's letter, along with a richly biographical article that John had written about his colorful great uncle in 1983 for Nevada Magazine.</p> <p><strong>FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT</strong> (1882-1945), often referred to by his initials FDR, was the 32nd president of the United States.

Johnson being sworn in, following the assassination of President John Kennedy. </strong>Above his original signature Stoughton has also printed the date and place of JFK's assassination and Johnson's oath of office aboard Air Force One. To the left of Johnson is Jacqueline Kennedy, widow of Kennedy (still wearing her blood-splattered dress); to his right is Lady Bird Johnson, and sitting down near the airplane window is Jack Valenti, an aide to Johnson who later was president of the Motion Picture Association of America.<br/><br/><strong>CECIL W. STOUGHTON</strong> (1920-2008) was an American photographer. Stoughton, a captain in the United States Army Signal Corp, was assigned to the White House Army Signal Agency, and is best known for being President John F. Kennedy's photographer during his White House years. Stoughton's behind-the-scene pictures of John and Jacqueline and their children in their public and personal life were pivotal in shaping the public's view of the U.S. first family. He took over eight thousand pictures of the family spanning the 34-month period beginning with Kennedy's inauguration and ending with his assassination.<br/><br/>Stoughton was present at the motorcade at which Kennedy was assassinated, and was subsequently the only photographer on board Air Force One when Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in as the next President. Stoughton's famous photograph of this event depicts Johnson raising his hand in oath as he stood between his wife Lady Bird Johnson and a still blood-spattered Jacqueline Kennedy. Stoughton also served as White House photographer during Johnson's first two years in office, and recounted this service in an oral history contributed to the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum.</p> <p>In the immediate chaotic aftermath of the assassination, Stoughton  learned that Johnson was being sworn in on the aircraft on a Dallas  airfield and rushed over in a car. As he was running across  the tarmac, the Secret Service thought it was another assassination  attempt and almost fired at him. As reported at the time, Stoughton's  camera jammed just as Johnson was about to be sworn in but he gave it a  good shake and it starting working again.</p> <p>Though the program was taped in June 2008, Stoughton was featured on the television series <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/archive/200702A13.html"" target=""_blank"">Antiques Roadshow</a> when it aired on November 3, 2008âcoincidentally, the day of his deathârecounting his story and presenting prints of his photographs from his personal collection, including a print of this photograph of Johnson being sworn in that the President had signed to Stoughton. A partial transcript of the story in his own words:</p> <blockquote>""I was in Dallas during the horrible assassination. I was in one of the cars in the motorcade five cars back. Heard three very distinct reports, sounded like rifle shots. Didn't know where they came from. A few minutes later, I was on my way to the Air Force One. I had seen vice president Johnson leaving the hospital and I asked where he was going and someone said, âThe president's going to Washington.' So that meant that Kennedy had expired in the hospital, where I was standing outside the operating room door there. And I said, âSo am I.' And I picked up my camera and went out to the plane. And when I got there, the press secretary, acting press secretary, Malcolm Kilduff, said, âThank God you're here, Cecil.' He said, âThe president's going to take his oath on the plane and you're going to have to service the wires with the photograph.'

Dr. Oscar Ivanissevich, the new Argentine ambassador to the U.S., was presenting his credentials to President Harry Truman. Dr. Ivanissevich was smiling and the President was smiling, and they were both saying what fine countries the other represented. It was hard to remember that only a few months ago the State Department was spreading the idea that Argentina's President Juan Peron was nothing but a fascist jerk.""</em></p></blockquote>   <p>A few years later, on May 29, 1950, <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,888809,00.html"" target=""_blank"">Time</a> reported the end of Ivanissevich's service to PerÃ³n:</p>   <blockquote><p><em>""In all the vast expanse of his fatherland, no more ardent or versatile Peronista ever breathed than Oscar Ivanissevich, 45, onetime Argentine Ambassador to the U.S. As a surgeon he had removed the appendixes of both President and SeÃ±ora PerÃ³n. As a poet he had composed the official party march, Peronista Boys. As Minister of Education, he distributed to his schoolchildren a saccharine pamphlet on Evita, ""The Good Fairy of Argentina."" Every morning on entering his office he bowed low to his patrons' pictures on the wall.... Last week PerÃ³n accepted Ivanissevich's resignation. Ivan had already retired to the sleepy provincial capital of La Rioja (pop. 15,000). For the immediate future, Oscar Ivanissevich planned to stick to poetry and medicine.""</em></p></blockquote>   <p>It is exceedingly rare to come across diplomatic gifts such as this. It is not known when President Truman gave this inscribed photo to the Ambassador, but it is likely one of the two dates mentioned above, since Ivanissevich does not appear on Truman's calendar at any other time.</p> <p><strong>Harry S. Truman</strong> was the thirty-third President of the United States (1945-1953). As vice president, he succeeded Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died less than three months after he began his fourth term. Though his presidency was challenged domestically time after time, it was notable for many landmark events: in 1945 he ordered the Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, effectively ending World War II; he established the Central Intelligence Agency; and he promulgated the Truman Doctrine to contain communism, the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after WWII, the creation of NATO, and the start of the Korean War. </p>   <h3><strong>Description of the Letter &amp; Framed Presentation</strong></h3>   <p><strong>HARRY S.

I have not yet recd the copy mentioned in your Letter. I think a considerable number of the article(s) might be usefully distributed in &amp; from Washington. I thank you my dear Sir for the friendly sentiments which you express in regard to my recent political conduct.<br/><br/>With much regard<br/>Your friend and obedient servant,<br/>Danl Webster<br/><br/>E.H. Derby Esq<br/>Boston</em><br/></blockquote> In Webster's infamous ""Seventh of March Address"" to the Senate four months earlier, he supported the Compromise of 1850, five separate laws that were intended to balance sectional interests by (1) admitting California to the union as a free state; (2) allowing the New Mexico and Utah territories to determine the slavery issue by relying on popular sovereignty; (3) reimbursing Texas $10 million from the federal government for the loss of the New Mexico territory (4) abolishing the slave trade in the District of Columbia; and (5) enacting a new, harsher Fugitive Slave Act. All five bills passed. As secretary of state, Webster supervised the strict enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act. His stand infuriated and alienated Northern antislavery forces and divided the Whig party, but delayed secession of the Southern statesâand warâfor a few years.  <br/> <br/> The letter has been tape hinged to an early 8.5 x 11.5 card to which has also been affixed the free-franked address panel (signed again by Webster) and intact wax seal. Hinging as noted, and light soiling to mailing panel, otherwise fine condition. <br/> <br/> <strong>DANIEL WEBSTER</strong>  (1782-1852) was a leading American statesman during the nation's Antebellum Period. He first rose to regional prominence through his defense of New England shipping interests. His increasingly nationalistic views and the effectiveness with which he articulated them led Webster to become one of the most famous orators and influential Whig leaders of the Second Party System. <br/> <br/> Daniel Webster was an attorney, and served as legal counsel in several cases that established important constitutional precedents that bolstered the authority of the Federal government. As Secretary of State, he negotiated the Webster-Ashburton Treaty that established the definitive eastern border between the United States and Canada. Primarily recognized for his Senate tenure, Webster was a key figure in the institution's ""Golden days"". So well-known was his skill as a Senator throughout this period that Webster became the northern member of a trio known as the ""Great Triumvirate"", with his colleagues Henry Clay from the west and John C. Calhoun from the south. His ""Reply to Hayne"" in 1830 was generally regarded as ""the most eloquent speech ever delivered in Congress."" <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Depicting a rural cemetery in the foreground with gravestones illuminated by the setting sun. a waxing moon hovers above a bank of clouds that meet mountains framing the horizon.</p> <p>Ours is actually one of the rare, large photographic posters (24 by 36 inches), signed by the eminent photographer at the bottom. The original poster is completely intact, but it has been discretely fan-folded between the image and the signature by a previous owner, and professionally mounted, French matted, and conservation framed in black lacquerâmeasuring 28"" x 30"" overallâin order to direct visual focus on the striking beauty of the image without the ""posterized"" effect. Still, it remains one of only 350 such litho posters published in the early 1980s in the first set of a 3-image series that Adams signed just prior to his death. </p> <p>One of the original images with the very finest tonal qualities, believed to be less than ten in existence, recently sold at auction for $360,000. ""Lesser"" prints sell in the range of $50,000. According to an AP report:</p> <blockquote><p>""The story associated with the picture is the stuff of legend. After a discouraging day in the field with his son and an assistant, Adams was driving home, when he ""saw an extraordinary situationâan inevitable photograph! I almost ditched the car and rushed to set up my 8 x 10 inch view camera...but I could not find my exposure meter! The situation was desperate: the low sun was trailing the edge of clouds in the west, and shadow would seem to dim the white crosses."" Adams had pre-visualized the image, managing to capture the picture before the sun set and light irrevocably shifted."" </p></blockquote> <p>These special posters were published by the New York Graphic Society as a way to market a fine, signed Ansel Adams product that was affordable for most people. Our understanding is that it was quite a difficult project with numerous delays, changes and multiple printings. The final printed image was intended to be almost indistinguishable from an original photograph and was printed on a heavy stock of paper, which is easily seen in this beautifully framed example. </p> <p align=""center""><img alt=""Ansel Adams Moonrise Poster Signed"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_1EB49C70-1517-6111-2816456440CE7B42.jpg"" title=""Ansel Adams Moonrise Poster Signed"" width=""239""/><br/><em>Example of original poster before framing</em></p> <p align=""center"">Â </p>  ",1981,3500,0,FALSE,3003,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/EE5634FC-1517-6111-28B18738249E225C.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1EB3C1EE-1517-6111-28B51F522F8F15B6.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1EB43C3F-1517-6111-286FBEC716BB4FC0.jpg",

Adams first visited Yosemite National Park in 1916 with his family. The famous valley was the first place in the United States to be designated a protected nature area by a Congressional act, signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1864. He wrote of his first view of the valley which so inspired him, ""the splendor of Yosemite burst upon us and it was glorious...One wonder after another descended upon us...There was light everywhere...A new era began for me."" </p>   <p>His father gave him his first camera, a Kodak Brownie box camera, during that stay and he took his first photographs with his ""usual hyperactive enthusiasm"", as has been described of Adams. He returned to Yosemite on his own the following year with better cameras and a tripod. In the winter, he learned basic darkroom technique working part-time for a San Francisco photo finisher. Adams avidly read photography magazines, attended camera club meetings, and went to photography and art exhibits. With his Uncle Frank he explored the High Sierra, in summer and winter, developing the stamina and skill needed to photograph at high altitude and under difficult weather conditions.</p>   <p>In 1927, Adams contracted for his first portfolio, in his new style, which included his famous image <em>Monolith</em>, the vertical western face of Half Dome taken with his Korona view camera utilizing glass plates and a dark red filter (to heighten the tonal contrasts). On that excursion, he had only one plate left and he ""visualized"" the effect of the blackened sky before risking the last shot. As he wrote, ""I had been able to realize a desired image: not the way the subject appeared in reality but how it felt to me and how it must appear in the finished print"". As he wrote confidently in April, 1927, ""My photographs have now reached a stage when they are worthy of the world's critical examination. I have suddenly come upon a new style which I believe will place my work equal to anything of its kind.""</p> <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Fargo as president, John Butterfield as secretary, and Alex Holland as treasurer. In good condition with even tears at the three folds to the midpoint, professionally conservation framed.</p> <p>John Butterfield, a legend in his own right, was the largest operator of stagecoach and freight lines in the mid-19th century in the American Northeast and Southwest. Through shrewd business acumen, he soon controlled most of the stage lines west of New York and in 1849 formed the Butterfield, Wasson &amp; Company. The following year, he merged his company with two rivals, Wells &amp; Company and Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company, to form the American Express Company. In 1868 the company merged with Merchants Union Express Company to become American Merchants Union Express Company. In 1873, the name was changed back to American Express.</p> <p>With fellow express freight colleague Henry Wells, William Fargo was co-founder of Wells, Fargo &amp; Co. Both men helped organize the American Express Company. Fargo served as the company's president from 1868 until his death. After the discovery of gold in California, both Wells and Fargo recognized the desperate need of Westerners for expanded banking and express facilities. American Express was happy to stay in the East. So Fargo made his historic decision with Wells to found Wells Fargo &amp; Co.âa company that was soon busy buying gold dust, selling drafts and doing a general banking and express business.</p> <p>The certificate's vignette features a dog, the traditional mascot of American Express preceding the centurion. </p>  ",1865,850,0,FALSE,3918,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8A77A66A-1517-6111-28248F94E41D3299.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/3CB004FD-1517-6111-2852F64A834EA332.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8A7886F6-1517-6111-288BCA8A6AFCA1BD.jpg","Henry Wells,  John Butterfield"

More than 300,000 persons have fled from behind the Iron Curtain in the past three years.

For those who reach sanctuary, hope would be spare indeed but for the work of the rescue committee... More than a work of mercy is involved here, however. These refugees, particularly the more recent ones, are able to provide valuable information as to what is going on behind the Iron Curtain, of which our limited knowledge is a distinct military handicap.

Her most famous works are the 1961 cookbook <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> and, showcasing her <em>sui generis</em> television persona, the series <em>The French Chef</em>, which premiered in 1963.</p>   <p>Julia Child grew up in Pasadena, California, eating traditional New England food prepared by the family maid. Her father was of Irish descent. She attended Polytechnic School from fourth grade to ninth grade and then The Branson School in Ross, California. After graduating in 1934 from Smith Collegeâwhere at 6 feet, 2 inches tall she played basketballâwith a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, she moved to New York City and worked as a copywriter for the advertising department of upscale home-furnishing firm W. &amp; J. Sloane. After returning to California in 1937, shortly before her mother died, she spent four years at home, writing for local publications and briefly working in advertising again.</p>   <p>Being civic-minded, she volunteered with the American Red Cross and, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941, joined the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) after being turned down by the United States Navy for being too tall. (The OSS was broken up by President Truman in September of 1945, eventually to be replaced by the Central Intelligence Agency). She began her OSS career at its headquarters in Washington, working directly for General William J. Donovan, the leader of OSS. Working as a research assistant in the Secret Intelligence division, Julia typed up thousands of names on white note cards used to keep track of enemy officers.</p>   <p>When it was first published in 1961 by Alfred A. Knopf, the 734-page <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em> was a best-seller and received critical acclaim that derived in part from the American interest in French culture in the early 1960s. Lauded for its helpful illustrations, precise attention to detail, and for making fine cuisine accessible to the masses, the book is still in print and is considered a seminal culinary work. Following this success, Child wrote magazine articles and a regular column for The Boston Globe newspaper.</p>   <p>A 1962 appearance on a book review show on the National Educational Television (NET) station of Boston, WGBH led to the inception of her television cooking show after viewers enjoyed her demonstration of how to cook an omelette. <em>The French Chef</em> debuted February 11, 1963 on WGBH and was immediately successful. The show ran nationally for ten years and won Peabody and Emmy Awards, including the very first Emmy award for an Educational program. Though she was not the first television cook, Child was the most widely seen. Her primary ""competitor"" for viewers was Britain's <em>The Galloping Gourmet</em>, another successful cooking show of the time.</p>   <p>In 2001, she moved to a retirement community in Santa Barbara, California, donating her house and office to Smith College. She donated her kitchen, which her husband designed with high counters to accommodate her diminished but still formidable height, and which served as the set for three of her television series, to the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, where it is now on display in Washington, D.C.</p>   <p>She received the French Legion of Honor in 2000 and the US Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2003. Child also received honorary doctorates from Harvard University, her alma mater Smith College, and several other universities.</p>   <p>Her husband, Paul, who was ten years older, died in 1994 after living in a nursing home for five years following a series of strokes in 1989.

 Samuel Clemens, Samuel,Clemens,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/mark-twain-the-prince-and-the-pauper-signed/,The Prince & the Pauper SIGNED,"  <p><strong>Exceedingly rare signed copy of the 1892 illustrated edition of Mark Twain's <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em>. Originally published in Canada in 1881 (1882 in the US), <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> was Twain's first book following <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> (1876).</strong> It was his first attempt at historical fiction, and ranks among his earliest and most endearing social satires.</p> <p>When Samuel Clemens started his own publishing house in May 1884, he hired his nephew Charles Webster to manage it and the company took Webster's name as publisher. James R. Osgood, Clemens's former publisher, declared bankruptcy in 1885, handing Twain the opportunity to acquire rights to all of his titles that were published by Osgood, which could then be published under Twain's own Webster imprint. Webster then reissued this and other editions of <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em>, along with other books by Twain as well as many other notable authors of the day.</p> <p>These Webster editions were bound in matching light tan bindings to appeal to buyers on a more limited budget who also wanted uniformity. In tightly-woven golden/brown cloth-covered boards with bright illustrations on cover, bright gilt lettering on a firm spine with a black emblem of three plumes; interior is intact and tight, with only slight lower edge damage to a couple front endpapers, and very mild toning on the title page, not affecting the signature. With 60 black and white illustrations throughout penned by Frank Thayer Merrill, whose work pleased Clemens in the original 1881 edition.</p> <p>12mo (duodecimo), 8"" x 6"" 289 pages plus nine advertisements at the back. Very Good ++ condition, without dust jacket as issued. SIGNED ""Mark Twain"" on the title page. Additional photos provided on request.</p> <p>Set in 16th-century England, <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> is the story of two uncannily identical but discontented boys ""temporarily"" exchanging roles in life, and the consequences they encounter in doing so. Edward, the young Prince of Wales, yearns for freedom and adventure, a ""normal"" life away from the strict formalities of the royal court. With the help of Tom Canty, a beggar's son, he realizes his dream is not at all what he had expected.</p> <p>As Edward experiences the brutish life of a pauper firsthand, he becomes aware of the stark class inequality in England. In particular, he sees the harsh, punitive nature of the English judicial system where people are burned at the stake, pilloried, and flogged. Tom, posing as the prince, tries to cope with court customs and manners. His fellow nobles and palace staff think ""the prince"" has an illness which has caused memory loss and fear he will go mad. They repeatedly ask him about the missing ""Great Seal,"" but he knows nothing about it; however, when Tom is asked to sit in on judgments, his common-sense observations reassure them his mind is sound.</p> <p>As is typical with Mark Twain's books, morals abound: how perception often determines our reality; that walking in the shoes of another isn't always what it's made out to be; that the abuse of power has severe consequences. </p> <p>A very rare signed copy in spectacular shape, especially for being over 120 years old.</p>  ",1892,sold,1,FALSE,3709,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/16457DAA-1517-6111-2883E1F974F741D9.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1646600B-1517-6111-284E8175CCC65204.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1647428C-1517-6111-2877A3D319FA65D2.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1646CD8A-1517-6111-2803FD9388A1E2C5.jpg",Samuel Clemens
 Samuel Clemens, Samuel,Clemens,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/mark-twain-signed-photo-savage-club-london/,Signed Photo from Savage Club Members,"  <p><strong>Portrait photograph boldly and clearly signed on the image, ""Mark Twain"", 6 July 1907. The photograph is a marvelous head and shoulders image of the famed American author by Ernest H. Mills of Hampstead, 5.5"" x 7.75"" (visible portion), set in a mount bearing printed inscription ""Mark Twain From his Brother Savages July 6th [19]07"" surrounded by printed signatures of more than 200 members of the Savage Club, 11"" x 14"".</strong> Both the image and the mount are in lamentable condition, with significant silvering to corners of image extending inward, moderate browning, with substantial tears and wear to mount. Still, only one of these has ever been seen at auction (<a href=""http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=5080792"" target=""_blank"">Christie's London in 2008</a>) until this one emerged, and as it holds such prominence in Twain's estimation, it remains an exceedingly rare and desirable photograph with outstanding association.</p> <p>The Savage Club, founded in 1857, is a bohemian gentlemen's club in London, ""formed to supply the want which Dr Samuel Johnson and his friends experienced when they founded the Literary Club. A little band of authors, journalists and artists felt the need of a place of reunion where, in their hours of leisure, they might gather together and enjoy each other's society, apart from the publicity of that which was known in Johnson's time as the coffee house, and equally apart from the chilling splendour of the modern club.""</p> <p><strong>THE SAVAGE CLUB DINNER</strong></p> <p>This portrait of Mr. Clemens, signed by all the members of the club attending the dinner, was presented to him, July 6, 1907, and his speech on that occasion opened with his appreciation of the  gift:<em> ""I am very glad indeed to have that portrait ... This is the best I  have had, and I am glad to have your honored names on it.""</em> This visit  to England was also the occasion of Twain's receiving a D.Litt. at  Oxford University..</p> <p>The Savage Club would inevitably want to entertain him on its own account, and their dinner of July 6th was a handsome, affair. He felt at home with the Savages, and put on his trademark white suit for the only time publicly in England. He wrote for them one of his reminiscent speeches, recalling his association with them on his first visit to London, thirty-seven years before. The speech, containing many of Twain's wittiest observations on literature and camaraderie, reads in full:</p> <blockquote><p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-SAVAGES,<br/>I am very glad indeed to have that portrait. I think it is the best one that I have ever had, and there have been opportunities before to get a good photograph. I have sat to photographers twenty-two times to-day. Those sittings added to those that have preceded them since I have been in Europeâif we average at that rateâmust have numbered one hundred to two hundred sittings. Out of all those there ought to be some good photographs. This is the best I have had, and I am glad to have your honored names on it. I did not know Harold Frederic personally, but I have heard a great deal about him, and nothing that was not pleasant and nothing except such things as lead a man to honor another man and to love him. I consider that it is a misfortune of mine that I have never had the luck to meet him, and if any book of mine read to him in his last hours made those hours easier for him and more comfortable, I am very glad and proud of that. I call to mind such a case many years ago of an English authoress, well known in her day, who wrote such beautiful child tales, touching and lovely in every possible way. In a little biographical sketch of her I found that her last hours were spent partly in reading a book of mine, until she was no longer able to read. That has always remained in my mind, and I have always cherished it as one of the good things of my life. I had read what she had written, and had loved her for what she had done.  Stanley apparently carried a book of mine feloniously away to Africa, and I have not a doubt that it had a noble and uplifting influence there in the wilds of Africaâbecause on his previous journeys he never carried anything to read except Shakespeare and the Bible. I did not know of that circumstance. I did not know that he had carried a book of mine. I only noticed that when he came back he was a reformed man. I knew Stanley very well in those old days. </p><p>Stanley was the first man who ever reported a lecture of mine, and that was in St. Louis. When I was down there the next time to give the same lecture I was told to give them something fresh, as they had read that in the papers. I met Stanley here when he came back from that first expedition of his which closed with the finding of Livingstone. You remember how he would break out at the meetings of the British Association, and find fault with what people said, because Stanley had notions of his own, and could not contain them. They had to come out or break him up--and so he would go round and address geographical societies. He was always on the warpath in those days, and people always had to have Stanley contradicting their geography for them and improving it. But he always came back and sat drinking beer with me in the hotel up to two in the morning, and he was then one of the most civilized human beings that ever was. </p><p>I saw in a newspaper this evening a reference to an interview which appeared in one of the papers the other day, in which the interviewer said that I characterized Mr. Birrell's speech the other day at the Pilgrims' Club as ""bully."" Now, if you will excuse me, I never use slang to an interviewer or anybody else. That distresses me. Whatever I said about Mr. Birrell's speech was said in English, as good English as anybody uses. If I could not describe Mr. Birrell's delightful speech without using slang I would not describe it at all. I would close my mouth and keep it closed, much as it would discomfort me.  </p><p>Now that comes of interviewing a man in the first person, which is an altogether wrong way to interview him. It is entirely wrong because none of you, I, or anybody else, could interview a manâcould listen to a man talking any length of time and then go off and reproduce that talk in the first person. It can't be done. What results is merely that the interviewer gives the substance of what is said and puts it in his own language and puts it in your mouth. It will always be either better language than you use or worse, and in my case it is always worse. I have a great respect for the English language. I am one of its supporters, its promoters, its elevators. I don't degrade it. A slip of the tongue would be the most that you would get from me. I have always tried hard and faithfully to improve my English and never to degrade it. I always try to use the best English to describe what I think and what I feel, or what I don't feel and what I don't think.  </p><p>I am not one of those who in expressing opinions confine themselves to facts. I don't know anything that mars good literature so completely as too much truth. Facts contain a deal of poetry, but you can't use too many of them without damaging your literature. I love all literature, and as long as I am a doctor of literatureâI have suggested to you for twenty years I have been diligently trying to improve my own literature, and now, by virtue of the University of Oxford, I mean to doctor everybody else's.  </p><p>Now I think I ought to apologize for my clothes. At home I venture things that I am not permitted by my family to venture in foreign parts. I was instructed before I left home and ordered to refrain from white clothes in England. I meant to keep that command fair and clean, and I would have done it if I had been in the habit of obeying instructions, but I can't invent a new process in life right away. I have not had white clothes on since I crossed the ocean until now.  </p><p>In these three or four weeks I have grown so tired of gray and black that you have earned my gratitude in permitting me to come as I have. I wear white clothes in the depth of winter in my home, but I don't go out in the streets in them. I don't go out to attract too much attention. I like to attract some, and always I would like to be dressed so that I may be more conspicuous than anybody else.  </p><p>If I had been an ancient Briton, I would not have contented myself with blue paint, but I would have bankrupted the rainbow. I so enjoy gay clothes in which women clothe themselves that it always grieves me when I go to the opera to see that, while women look like a flower-bed, the men are a few gray stumps among them in their black evening dress. These are two or three reasons why I wish to wear white clothes: When I find myself in assemblies like this, with everybody in black clothes, I know I possess something that is superior to everybody else's. Clothes are never clean. You don't know whether they are clean or not, because you can't see.  </p><p>Here or anywhere you must scour your head every two or three days or it is full of grit. Your clothes must collect just as much dirt as your hair. If you wear white clothes you are clean, and your cleaning bill gets so heavy that you have to take care. I am proud to say that I can wear a white suit of clothes without a blemish for three days. If you need any further instruction in the matter of clothes I shall be glad to give it to you. I hope I have convinced some of you that it is just as well to wear white clothes as any other kind. I do not want to boast. I only want to make you understand that you are not clean.  </p><p>As to age, the fact that I am nearly seventy-two years old does not clearly indicate how old I am, because part of every day it is with me as with you, you try to describe your age, and you cannot do it. Sometimes you are only fifteen; sometimes you are twenty-five. It is very seldom in a day that I am seventy-two years old. I am older now sometimes than I was when I used to rob orchards; a thing which I would not do to-dayâif the orchards were watched. I am so glad to be here to- night. I am so glad to renew with the Savages that now ancient time when I first sat with a company of this club in London in 1872. That is a long time ago. But I did stay with the Savages a night in London long ago, and as I had come into a very strange land, and was with friends, as I could see, that has always remained in my mind as a peculiarly blessed evening, since it brought me into contact with men of my own kind and my own feelings.  </p><p>I am glad to be here, and to see you all again, because it is very likely that I shall not see you again. It is easier than I thought to come across the Atlantic. I have been received, as you know, in the most delightfully generous way in England ever since I came here. It keeps me choked up all the time. Everybody is so generous, and they do seem to give you such a hearty welcome. Nobody in the world can appreciate it higher than I do. It did not wait till I got to London, but when I came ashore at Tilbury the stevedores on the dock raised the first welcomeâa good and hearty welcome from the men who do the heavy labor in the world, and save you and me having to do it. They are the men who with their hands build empires and make them prosper. It is because of them that the others are wealthy and can live in luxury. They received me with a ""Hurrah!"" that went to my heart. They are the men that build civilization, and without them no civilization can be built. So I came first to the authors and creators of civilization, and I blessedly end this happy meeting with the Savages who destroy it. </p></blockquote> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Clemens was the notable literary figure in Berlin that winter, the center of every great gathering. He was entertained by the Kaiser earlier in the month, and shown many special attentions by Germans of every rank. One night, after delivering a lecture in a hot room, he contracted a severe cold, driving to a ball at General von Versen's, and a few days after was confined to his bed with pneumonia. </p>   <p><strong>Accompanied by a postcard addressed to Clemens from the aforementioned A. F. Kingscote, sent two days before Clemens' letter:</strong></p>   <blockquote><p><em>[To:] S. Clemens Esqre (alias Mark Twain) <br/>Hotel Royal, Berlin</em></p><p><em>Oxford Union Society, Oxford </em></p><p><em>I sincerely trust that you are getting better. My letter of the 4th reached you quite safely, I trust? It will give me great satisfaction to hear from you yrself (sic) soon how you really feel: for I was truly sorry to hear by the daily journals how ill you'd been.</em></p><p><em>Believe me, dr sir yrs very truly<br/>A. F. Kingscote</em></p></blockquote>   <p>Curiously, Clemens' letter to his publishers, no doubt written during his time of bed rest, asks them to find out who Mr. Kingscote is even though Kingscote's postcard inquiring about Clemens' health suggests a level of familiarity with him. </p>   <p>In very good condition, with intersecting folds, several professional repairs to tears on reverse, scattered toning, creasing, and wrinkling, and a vertical fold through a single letter of signature.</p> <p>The photo shown here was taken of Clemens in Berlin 1892, about the time he wrote this letter <em>(Photo not included in sale, used only for timeline reference).</em></p> <p>Â </p>   <p>COA from PSA/DNA. <meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->Moreover, all Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In full: ""Enclosed please find the final installment of rent for this delightful house, which I hope we are not occupying for the last time."" </strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>SAMUEL LANGHORNE CLEMENS</strong> (1835-1910), better known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American humorist, satirist, lecturer and writer. Twain is most noted for his novels <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, which has since been called the Great American Novel, and <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>.</p>   <p>Clemens fell into a deep depression following the death of his favorite daughter Susy in 1896, likely accounting for the mourning stationery. In good condition, with staining and soiling (evidently from exposure to moisture; touching several words of text; lightly touching signature) and slight scattered fading of ink. Integral leaf intact.</p> <p>Though Clemens became wealthy as a result of his major literary works, later efforts were not as rewarding. He had vigorously begun to write articles and commentary with diminishing returns to pay the bills and keep his business interests afloat, but eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1894. Clemens and his family spent most of the 1890s in Europe seeking lower living costs, as he lectured and wrote his way out of debt. When he finally returned to New York in 1900, his debts fully repaid and his income back up in the $90,000 range, the event was regarded as a national triumph.</p>   <p>He installed his family in a rented house, still standing, at <strong>14 West 10th Street</strong> in Greenwich Village (the address on the stationery Clemens used for this item, though struck-through since he had just moved to <strong>Wave Hill House</strong>), and settled down to bask in the admiration of his countrymen. Two years later, for the sake of his wife Livy's failing health, they moved to <strong>Wave Hill</strong>, a magnificent fieldstone mansion (also still standing) overlooking the Hudson in Riverdale, where Clemens had written this letter.</p>   <p>Wave Hill is now a renowned New York landmark and environmental center. Theodore Roosevelt's family rented Wave Hill during the summers of 1870 and â71, when the future president was a youth of 12 and 13. Mark Twain leased the estate from 1901-1903, setting up a treehouse parlor in the branches of a chestnut tree on the lawn. Of winter at Wave Hill he wrote, <em>""I believe we have the noblest roaring blasts here I have ever known on land; they sing their hoarse song through the big tree-tops with a splendid energy that thrills me and stirs me and uplifts me and makes me want to live always."" </em></p>   <p><strong><em>Curious side note:</em></strong> In a 2002 <em><a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E3DC113CF934A15753C1A9649C8B63&amp;fta=y"">New York Times </a></em><a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E3DC113CF934A15753C1A9649C8B63&amp;fta=y"">FYI Column</a> just before Halloween, a reader had inquired as to ""the most haunted house in the city."" Writer Ed Boland, Jr., replied:</p>   <blockquote><p>""... probably no one site is as notorious as <strong>14 West 10th Street</strong>, west of Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. </p><p>In 1974, a former actress turned psychic, Jan Bryant Bartell, detailed her experiences living in the house in the book ''Spindrift: Spray From a Psychic Sea.'' Ms. Bartell claimed that a number of tenants had died mysteriously and that the building was haunted by spirits. </p><p>One ghost who supposedly haunts No. 14 is Mark Twain, who lived there from 1900 to 1901. According to Ms. Bartell, a mother and daughter living on the ground floor in the 1930's found an old man with white hair in the living room one evening. When the startled mother asked him who he was, the figure replied, ''My name is Clemens, and I has a problem here I gotta settle'' and disappeared. (Twain, known more formally as Samuel L. Clemens, had died in Connecticut in 1910.)...</p></blockquote>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Exceptional provenance from the esteemed collection of a pioneer in autograph dealers, Charles Hamilton, with his Certificate of Authenticity on reverse.</p> <h4>And if you ever wondered (or forgot) HOW he chose that name...</h4> <p>Clemens maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a depth indicating ""safe water"" for the boat to float over, was measured on the sounding line. A fathom is a maritime unit of depth, equivalent to two yards (1.8 m); ""twain"" is an archaic term for ""two"". The riverboatman's cry was ""mark twain"" or, more fully, ""by the mark twain"", meaning ""according to the mark [on the line], [the depth is] two [fathoms]"", that is, ""there are 12 feet (3.7 m) of water under the boat and it is safe to pass"".</p> <p>Twain claimed that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In Life on the Mississippi, he wrote:</p> <blockquote><p>""Captain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them ""MARK TWAIN,"" and give them to the New Orleans Picayune. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable; ... At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands-a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.""</p></blockquote> <p>Twain's version of the story regarding his nom de plume is not without detractors and has been called into question by biographer George Williams III, the Territorial Enterprise newspaper and Purdue University's Paul Fatout. These sources claim that ""mark twain"" refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper's saloon in Virginia City, Nevada.</p>  ",1901,sold,1,FALSE,3612,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/B15EFF8D-1517-6111-28E9BBFC14FD9BE5.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8C82E5F9-1517-6111-2800C7BB439E998C.png",Samuel Clemens

He led raids on both sides of the Southwestern border,  eluding capture by both the Mexican and U.S. Armies for nearly three  decades. He is often considered the last ""hold out,"" refusing to  recognize American occupation of the region, and leading an independent  band of native people. <br/><br/>Geronimo was finally captured in 1886 by a  troop of the 4th Cavalry led by Captain Henry Lawton under General  Nelson Miles. Geronimo himself gave credit to 1st. Lieut. Charles  Gatewood, whom he knew and who spoke some Apache, as being the person  who convinced him to surrender, but Lawton gave credit to a number of  his men, and, of course, many others claimed the feat over the years.  Geronimo would spend the remainder of his life as a prisoner of war.  After he was moved to Fort Sill, OK in 1894, Geronimo was given some  freedom. </p> <p>He quickly understood commercialism and he became his own best PR man as he realized the value of all things connected with him. His appearances generated much interest at the Omaha Exposition of 1898, the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, the <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">St. Louis World's Fair in 1904</a>, Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration parade in 1905, numerous Wild West shows, and other public events. Promoters of these events had to appeal to the War Department to obtain permission for his appearance. At many of the events Geronimo would sell his autograph, photographs of himself as well as bows and arrows. In his autobiography, Geronimo talks about his experience at the St. Louis World's fair, ""I often made as much as two dollars a day, and when I returned I had plenty of money Â­ more than I had ever owned before. I am glad I went to the Fair."" </p> <p>At some point in his captivity, Geronimo  learned to read a bit and  write his name, and later even embraced  Christianity. His writing  always had a child-like quality, and he  preferred pencil to pen. He  seemed to like to embellish his signature,  sometimes putting designs in  the ""G,"" often filling in the ""O's,"" as in  this signature. Sometimes  all letters were serifed, sometimes only a few  were. </p> <p>Contrary to this supposed life of leisure Geronimo and the Apache people suffered both physically and mentally. During their stay in Florida and Alabama many Apaches died of tuberculosis and other diseases. Throughout the time spent as a prisoner of war, Geronimo never stopped asking to be allowed to return to his homeland in the Southwest. He died a prisoner of war at Fort Sills. </p> <p><img alt=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2ED01AA5-1517-6111-28A69F54C084AEB7.png"" title=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" width=""244""/><br/><em>Geronimo in the Indian Village at the 1901<br/>Pan American Exposition, Buffalo, New York.<br/>Image from the Library of Congress.</em></p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Before the Battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull had a vision in which he saw the defeat of the 7th Cavalry under Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer on June 25, 1876. Sitting Bull's leadership inspired his people to a major victory. Months after winning that decisive battle, Sitting Bull and his group left the United States for Wood Mountain, Northwest Territories (now Saskatchewan), where he remained until 1881, at which time he and most of his band returned to US territory and surrendered to U.S. forces. </p> <p>After working as a performer with Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, Sitting Bull returned to the Standing Rock Agency in South Dakota.

Though he learned and spoke English fairly well, anything written or signed by Iron Tail is exceedingly scarce and rarely comes to market. Accompanied by an actual vintage photograph </strong><strong>showing Iron Tail in a tribal dance </strong><strong>(approx 2 inches square) taken by the original Swiss collector who obtained the signed drawing </strong><strong>personally at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show circa 1900; plus two</strong><strong> vintage postcards of Iron Tail in regalia, and of his squaws with papooses at the Wild West Show. Provenance included in original album containing other unknown autographs gathered by this </strong><strong>European collector, from whose estate we have acquired many historic and authentically signed items.</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>IRON TAIL</strong> (1857-1955) (aka <em>Sinte Maza</em> and <em>Wasu Maza</em>, among other variations) was an Oglala Sioux (Lakota). He fought under Crazy Horse in 1876 at the Battle of Little Bighorn when he was just eighteen years old. Little Bighorn was a victory for the Sioux but shortly after the battle, Iron Tail followed Chief Sitting Bull into exile in Canada. They surrendered to US forces at Fort Buford in July of 1881, were pardoned, and allowed to settle on the Great Sioux Reservation of South Dakota with promises of peace and non-interference.Â  In February of 1890, the United States government dissolved the Great Sioux Reservation.</p> <p>In an effort to break tribal identity, individuals were forced to farm on 320 acre family plots and children were sent away to government schools that forbid any inclusion of traditional culture and language. This same period was marked by a severe drought that decimated crops and livestock.Â  In response, many of the desperate Sioux embraced a religious movement known as the Ghost Dance. The unity of the Ghost Dancers frightened the Bureau of Indian Affairs and military troops were dispatched to quell what US officials saw as a brewing Indian revolution. Tensions came to a head in December 1890 when Sitting Bull was killed during an arrest attempt on the Standing Rock reservation. A group of Ghost Dancers fled to join Chief Big Foot (Sitting Bull's half-brother) on the Cheyenne River Reservation where Iron Tail and his family were also living at that time. Big Foot tried to move to the Pine Ridge Agency where Chief Red Cloud could broker a negotiated surrender, but the Army surrounded the group at Wounded Knee Creek. Approximately 150 Lakota died in the fighting, another 150 died of exposure and 25 U.S. troops also perished. Iron Tail was severely wounded and lost his mother, father, two brothers, sister, and wife in the massacre, and his infant son who died a short time later.  </p>   <p>After Wounded Knee, Iron Tail settled near Kyle on the Pine Ridge Reservation.Â  Eventually he found employment with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/william-f-cody-buffalo-bill-double-signed-autograph-signatures-cabinet-card"">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>'s Wild West Show.Â  Cody had many ties to the Sioux tribe, especially at the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock Agencies. Chief Sitting Bull toured with the show in 1885.Â  During those performances he famously ""blessed"" audiences, cursing them in the Lakota language to clamorous applause. Sitting Bull returned to Standing Rock at the end of that season but Cody continued to hire Sioux performers almost exclusively, including such prominent figures as <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-autographed-hand-drawn-signed-self-portrait-sketch-1901-signature"">Geronimo</a> and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rain-in-the-face-signature-autograph-signed-1893-columbian-exposition-custer-little-big-horn"">Rain-in-the-Face</a>. Iron Tail traveled throughout Europe and the United States with the Wild West show for nearly 15 years as a marquee attraction and became a close friend of Cody, who often proclaimed that, <em>""Iron Tail is the finest man I have ever known, bar none.""</em></p> Many of the Native Americans who found employment in the various Wild West Shows eventually returned home and used the skills and insights they had gained to improve the still desperate situation on the reservations.Â  Iron Tail had some powerful friends in William Cody and General Nelson A. Miles, whom he had met during the Army investigations of the Wounded Knee massacre. With their support, he traveled to Washington, DC around the turn of the century to seek reparations for the victims. While in Washington he sat for sculptor James Earle Fraser as one of three models for the visage found on the Indian Head nickel that was released in 1913.  <p>Â <img alt=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" height=""204"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_6279706E-1517-6111-28537926D52D3747.jpg"" title=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" width=""410""/></p>   <p>On the same trip, Iron Tail also met the Battle of Manila Bay hero Admiral George Dewey. When the Chief later converted to Catholicism he adopted the name Dewey Beard in honor of the General. Iron Tail, now Dewey Beard, remarried and had a son, became a rancher and raised horses, but still he remained a showman. He had parts in some ""westerns"" including Cody's silent film about Wounded Knee. Up until the last years of his life, he performed at regional powwows and tourist venues and used his visibility to speak out against the mistreatment of Native Americans. </p> <p>The following exemplar of a strikingly similar original signed drawing by Iron Tail appears in the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Bills-Wild-West-Warriors/dp/0061129771/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266882496&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude KÃ¤sebier</em></strong></a> by Michelle Delaney, Â© 2007 Smithsonian Institution (Collins, New York: 2007):</p> <p><img alt=""Iron Tail Drawing Exemplar"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_F80DCCF2-1517-6111-2873D9177EB86780.jpg"" title=""Iron Tail Drawing Exemplar"" width=""273""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Cody earned the nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in eighteen months (1867-68).</p>   <p>In addition to his documented service as a soldier during the Civil War and as Chief of Scouts for the Third Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to have worked many jobs, including as a trapper, bullwhacker, ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony Express rider in 1860, wagon master, stagecoach driver, and even a hotel manager, but it's unclear which claims were factual and which were fabricated for purposes of publicity. He became world famous for his Wild West show.</p>   <p>In December 1872 Cody traveled to Chicago to make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack Omohundro in <em>The Scouts of the Prairie</em>, one of the original Wild West shows produced by Ned Buntline. During the 1873-74 season, Cody and Omohundro invited their friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok to join them in a new play called <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p>The troupe toured for ten years and Cody's part typically included an 1876 incident at the Warbonnet Creek where he claimed to have scalped a Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge for the death of George Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p>It was the age of great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody put together a new traveling show based on both of those forms of entertainment.

The show began with a parade on horseback, with participants from horse-culture groups that included US and other military, American Indians, and performers from all over the world in their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos, Arabs, Mongols and Cossacks, among others, each showing their own distinctive horses and colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle could see main events, feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many authentic western personalities were part of the show. For example Sitting Bull and a band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline performers were well known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley and her husband Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the likes of Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed General Custer.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

The show typically ended with a melodramatic re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed   General Custer.</p> <p><strong>GORDON WILLIAM LILLIE</strong> (1860-1942) became famous as the Wild  West showman and performer <em><strong>Pawnee Bill</strong></em>.</p>   <p>In 1888  Lillie and his wife, May, launched their own Wild West show: ""Pawnee  Bill's Historic Wild West"". May starred in the show as the ""Champion  Girl Horseback Shot of the West."" Their first season was a financial  disaster. They re-organized as a smaller operation called ""Pawnee Bill's  Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show."" The show was  popular but not lucrative. Gordon Lillie added Jose Barrera to the cast;  he was widely popular performing as ""Mexican Joe"". In 1907 Lillie hired  performers from a variety of backgrounds. The show included Mexican  cowboys, Pawnee Indians, Japanese performers, and Arab jugglers. The  ensemble debuted as ""Pawnee Bill's Great Far East Show."" In 1908 Pawnee  Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the ""Two Bills' Show"".  That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.  After the show closed, Lillie returned to his and May's ranch to live  full time.</p>   <p> <meta name=""Title""/> <meta name=""Keywords""/> <meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/> <meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Generator""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Originator""/> <link href=""file://localhost/Users/garymcavoy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <o:DocumentProperties>   <o:Template>Normal.dotm</o:Template>   <o:Revision>0</o:Revision>   <o:TotalTime>0</o:TotalTime>   <o:Pages>1</o:Pages>   <o:Words>149</o:Words>   <o:Characters>853</o:Characters>   <o:Company>GetToTheTop</o:Company>   <o:Lines>7</o:Lines>   <o:Paragraphs>1</o:Paragraphs>   <o:CharactersWithSpaces>1047</o:CharactersWithSpaces>   <o:Version>12.0</o:Version>  </o:DocumentProperties>  <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>   <o:AllowPNG/>  </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:WordDocument>   <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>   <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves>   <w:TrackFormatting/>   <w:PunctuationKerning/>   <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>   <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>   <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/>   <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>   <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent>   <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>   <w:Compatibility>    <w:BreakWrappedTables/>    <w:DontGrowAutofit/>    <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables/>    <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx/>   </w:Compatibility>  </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=""false"" LatentStyleCount=""276"">  </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <style> <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	panose-1:2 5 6 4 5 5 5 2 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:auto; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-parent:""""; 	margin:0in; 	margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-hansi-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} --> </style> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> <!--StartFragment--> </p> Â  <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

""Buffalo Bill"" Cody, dated May 27th 1886 on vintage stationery from The Ebbitt Boarding House in Washington D.C.</strong>Â  One page, 6"" x 9"", written on both sides in black fountain pen, in good condition, with tape at folds and edges.</p> <p>Related in architectural history to today's Old Ebbitt Grill, Washington's oldest, most historic bar, the Ebbitt Boarding House &amp; Saloon hosted many eminent guests, including Presidents William McKinley, Ulysses S. Grant, Andrew Johnson, Grover Cleveland, Theodore Roosevelt, and Warren Harding.  </p>   <p>On May 27, 1886, Buffalo Bill Cody wrote the following letter to Joseph Holman, a judge in Sevier County, Arkansas, in an apparent response to the Judge's inquiry regarding two horse thieves whom Cody had captured:</p>   <blockquote><p><em>Dear Sir,</em></p><p><em>Yours of May 15th at hand asking the discription </em>(sic)<em> of two horse thieves I captured in 1869. Its along time ago and Williams I can't remember him very well. Bevins I have not </em>(seen) <em>as he served a long time in the Nebraska Penitentiary. Williams as well as I remember was a medium sized man, I think his hair and beard inclined to reddish. Would now be over 50 years old. That's all I remember about him.</em></p><p><em>Yours Truly,<br/> W. F. Cody<br/> Buffalo Bill</em></p></blockquote>   <p>The two thieves, Bevins and Williams, had stolen horses from the Army, and Cody and Captain W. Green were commissioned by the Army's General Carr to track down and arrest the pair, who were nabbed in Denver in 1869. Cody recounted this episode fairly colorfully in his 1879 autobiography, <strong><em>The Life and Adventures of Buffalo Bill</em></strong>:</p>   <blockquote><p>""When within four miles of Denver-this was on a Thursday-we learned that the horse-thieves had passed there two days before. I came to the conclusion they would attempt to dispose of the animals in Denver, and being aware that Saturday was the great auction day there, I thought it best to remain where we were at a hotel, and not go into the city until that day. It certainly would not have been advisable for me to have gone into Denver meantime-because I was well-known there, and if the thieves had learned of my presence in the city they would at once have suspected my business...</p><p>Early Saturday morning, we rode into town and stabled our horses at the Elephant Corral. I secured a room from Ed. Chase, overlooking the corral, and then took up my post of observation. I did not have long to wait, for a man, whom I readily recognized as one of our old packers, rode into the corral mounted upon Lieutenant Forbush's racing mule, and leading another government mule, which I also identified. It had been recently branded, and over the ""U.S."" was a plain ""D.B."" I waited for the man's companion to put in an appearance, but he did not come, and my conclusion was that he was secreted outside of the city with the rest of the animals. </p><p>Presently the black mule belonging to Forbush was put up at auction. Now, thought I, is the time to do my work. So, walking through the crowd, who were bidding for the mule, I approached the man who had offered him for sale. He recognized me and endeavored to escape, but I seized him by the shoulder, saying: ""I guess, my friend, that you'll have to go with me. If you make any resistance, I'll shoot you on the spot."" He was armed with a pair of pistols, which I took away from him. Then informing the auctioneer that I was a United States detective, and showing him-as well as an inquisitive officer-my commission as such, I told him to stop the sale, as the mule was stolen property, and that I had arrested the thief, whose name was Williams. </p><p>Farley and Green, who were near at hand, now came forward, and together we took the prisoner and the mules three miles down the Platte River; there, in a thick bunch of timber, we all dismounted and made preparations to hang Williams from a limb, if he did not tell us where his partner was. At first he denied knowing anything about any partner, or any other stock; but when he saw that we were in earnest, and would hang him at the end of the given time-five minutes-unless he ""squealed,"" he told us that his ""pal"" was at an unoccupied house three miles further down the river. </p><p>We immediately proceeded to the spot indicated, and as we came within sight of the house we saw our stock grazing near by. Just as we rode up to the door, another one of our old packers, whom I recognized as Bill Bevins, stepped to the front, and I covered him instantly with my rifle before he could draw his revolver. I ordered him to throw up his hands, and he obeyed the command. Green then disarmed him and brought him out. We looked through the house and found their saddles, pack-saddles, blankets, overcoats, lariats and two Henry rifles, which we took possession of. The horses and mules we tied in a bunch, and with the whole outfit we returned to Denver, where we lodged Williams and Bevins in jail, in charge of my friend, She riff Edward Cook. The next day we took them out, and, tying each one on a mule, we struck out on our return trip to Fort Lyon.""</p></blockquote> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

It is believed that all medals were destroyed after her death. Unsigned in fine condition, 3"" x 4"" mounted to light brown card with various markings from Culver Pictures on reverse. </p> <p><strong>Annie Oakley</strong> (1860-1926), born Phoebe Ann Mosey, was an American sharpshooter and exhibition shooter. Oakley's amazing talent and timely rise to fame led to a starring role in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which propelled her to become the first American female superstar.</p> <p>Using a .22 caliber rifle at 90 feet (27 m), Oakley reputedly could split a playing card edge-on and put five or six more holes in it before it touched the ground. Annie began hunting at age nine to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold the hunting game for money to locals in Greenville, as well as restaurants and hotels in southern Ohio. Her skill eventually paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15. </p> <p>Oakley soon became well known throughout the region. During the spring of 1881, the Baughman and Butler shooting act was being performed in Cincinnati. Traveling show marksman and former dog trainer Francis E. Butler, an Irish immigrant, placed a $100 bet per side (roughly equivalent to $2,000 in today's money) with Cincinnati hotel owner Jack Frost, that Butler, age 31, could beat any local fancy shooter. The hotelier arranged a shooting match with Oakley, age 21, to be held in ten days in a small town near Greenville, Ohio. After missing his 25th shot, Butler lost the match and the bet, but he began courting Oakley, and they married on June 20, 1882.</p> <p>Oakley continued to set records into her 60s, and she also engaged in extensive, albeit quiet, philanthropy for women's rights and other causes, including the support of specific young women that she knew. She embarked on a comeback and intended to star in a feature-length silent movie. In a 1922 shooting contest in Pinehurst, North Carolina, sixty-two-year-old Oakley hit 100 clay targets from 16 yards (15 m).</p> <p>Her health declined in 1925 and she died of pernicious anemia in Greenville, Ohio at the age of sixty-six in 1926. </p>  ",c1882,sold,1,FALSE,3544,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9C713131-1517-6111-28C972D6D3971B5A.png,William F.

A classic image of  Cody dressed in a fringed and beaded buckskin jacket with his long  curly hair flowing from beneath his hat. The verso is facsimile ink-stamped ""Yours  truly, W. F. Cody"".</strong><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>WILLIAM  FREDERICK ""BUFFALO BILL"" CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).  </p> <strong></strong> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs, including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872 Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season, Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that toured annually.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In 1893 the title was changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events, feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and  stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic  re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed  General Custer.</p>  ",c1880s,sold,1,FALSE,3452,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/52AF4B50-3048-C0CE-55427B56937B915F.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/73CCE217-1517-6111-28AEAC67D8664117.jpg",

The Company is dedicated to preserving the legacy of the ship, wreck site, and all her passengers and crew through educational, historical, scientific, and conservation based programs. Since discovery of the <em>Titanic</em> wreckage by noted oceanographer Dr. Robert Ballard in 1985, RMS Titanic, Inc. has honorably conducted eight subsequent research expeditions to the wreck of <em>Titanic</em> exclusively recovering and conserving more than 5,500 artifacts.<strong><br/></strong></p> <p>A US Federal Court has ruled that <em>Titanic</em>  coal  is the only rescued item from the ship that may be purchased by  the  public, making it a rare and valuable piece of historic memorabilia.

Millvina was the youngest passenger on board, and had no recollection of the sinking.</p> <p>Â </p> <object classid=""clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"" codebase=""http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"" height=""337"" width=""410""><param name=""width"" value=""410""/><param name=""height"" value=""337""/><param name=""wmode"" value=""opaque""/><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/MieCi1qzPK4""/><embed height=""337"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/MieCi1qzPK4"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""410"" wmode=""opaque""/></object> <br/> <br/> Millvina's parents decided to leave England and emigrate to Wichita, Kansas where her father had family living and where he hoped to open a tobacco shop. The Deans were not supposed to be aboard the  <em>Titanic</em> , but owing to a coal strike, they were transferred to the ship and boarded it as third-class passengers at Southampton, England. Millvina was barely two months old when she boarded the ship. Millvina's father felt the ship's collision with the iceberg on the night of 14 April 1912, and after investigating, returned to his cabin telling his wife to dress the children and go up on deck. Millvina, her mother, and brother were placed in Lifeboat 10 and were among the first steerage passengers to escape the sinking liner. Her father, however, did not survive, and his body, if recovered, was never identified. <br/> <br/> At first, Eva, Millvina's mother, wanted to continue on to Kansas to fulfill her husband's wish of a new life in America, but after losing her husband so tragically and being left with two small children to care for, she decided to go home. Millvina, her mother, and brother, returned to England aboard the  <em>RMS Adriatic</em> . While aboard the ship, Millvina attracted a lot of attention by being such a small child and surviving the disaster. An article in the Daily Mirror newspaper dated 12 May 1912 described the ordeal: <p>Â </p> <blockquote><em>""She was the pet of the liner during the voyage, and so keen was the rivalry between women to nurse this lovable mite of humanity that one of the officers decreed that first and second-class passengers might hold her in turn for no more than ten minutes.""</em></blockquote> <p>Millvina and her brother were raised mostly on pension funds and educated in neighboring Southampton schools, including The Gregg School. It was not until she was eight years old, and her mother was planning to remarry, that Dean found out she had been a passenger on the <em>Titanic</em>. Millvina never married, and worked for the British government during the Second World War and later as a purchaser for a local engineering firm. Other careers she has had were as a cartographer, a secretary and an assistant to a tobacconist.<br/><br/>Millvina's mother, Eva, died on 16 September 1975 at the age of 96, and her brother, Bertram, died at the age of 81 on 14 April 1992, coinciding with the 80th anniversary of the <em>Titanic</em> striking the iceberg.</p>  ",,450,0,FALSE,3823,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D8F2661F-1517-6111-28E398259A63E3CC.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D8F3AB41-1517-6111-28EB448B8CB9F497.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D8F4F584-1517-6111-28D191636EE2C069.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D8F58F24-1517-6111-284AE7A10EB879FB.jpg",

In good condition with even tears at the three folds to the midpoint, professionally conservation framed.</p> <p>John Butterfield, a legend in his own right, was the largest operator of stagecoach and freight lines in the mid-19th century in the American Northeast and Southwest. Through shrewd business acumen, he soon controlled most of the stage lines west of New York and in 1849 formed the Butterfield, Wasson &amp; Company. The following year, he merged his company with two rivals, Wells &amp; Company and Livingston, Fargo &amp; Company, to form the American Express Company. In 1868 the company merged with Merchants Union Express Company to become American Merchants Union Express Company.

Significantly, this certificate was issued in 1865 to one of New England's most prominent citizens, Mr. Henry C. Bowen of New York. </strong>A hugely successful silk merchant, in 1845 Bowen commissioned Joseph C. Wells, the English-born architect who designed Bowen's Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights, to design a summer home for the family in Woodstock. Wells designed a stunning five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot Gothic Revival cottage, called Roseland Cottage by the family, was completed in the fall of 1846.</p><p>While Roseland Cottage was primarily a family country retreat, during the second half of the nineteenth century the Bowens more frequently entertained distinguished guests and hosted large festivities at Roseland Cottage. Three United States presidents, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, and Rutherford B. Hayes, and three past and future presidential candidates, John C. Fremont, James G. Blaine, and William McKinley, in addition to a long list of senators, congressman, governors, and other political, literary, and social luminaries, made their way to Woodstock to participate in Bowen's renowned Fourth of July celebrations. Eventually these events grew so large that Bowen purchased an approximately sixty-acre parcel in Woodstock and developed an elegant public park, replete with gilded fountains, decorative statuary, windmill, boathouse, and private bungalows, in which to host his Fourth of July celebrations. The park, named Roseland Park, was first opened in 1876 and in accordance with Bowen's will is still open to the public today.</p><p style=""font-size: 1em"">Roseland Cottage, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992, remains one of the nation's best preserved examples of Gothic Revival architecture. Roseland Cottage provides visitors a glimpse of the lifestyle and tastes of an upwardly mobile, ambitious, and close-knit family during the Victorian era.<strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong><strong>Henry Bowen was issued Certificate </strong>#1330 for 3  shares at $500 each (the 2014 equivalent of $22,000) in the American Express Company, dated 2 January,  1865 and signed by William G.

Fossey's extraordinary efforts to ensure the future of the rain forest and its remaining mountain gorillas are captured in her own words in the book, which includes candid photographs of this fascinating endangered species. Although Fossey's work ended tragically in her murder, <em>Gorillas In The Mist</em> remains an invaluable testament to one of the longest-running field studies of primates and reveals her undying passion for her subject, and remains the best-selling book about gorillas of all time.</p> <p><strong>Dian Fossey</strong> (1932-1985) was an American zoologist who undertook an extensive study of gorilla groups over a period of 18 years.

A contemporary 8"" x 10"" black and white print on thick semi-gloss lab stock, signed in black Sharpie and in fine condition.</p> <p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">The Hindenburg disaster occurred on May 6, 1937, as the German passenger airship Hindenburg caught fire and was destroyed during its attempt to dock with its mooring mast at the U.S. Naval Air Station Lakehurst in Manchester Township, New Jersey. Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers and 61 crewmen), there were 35 fatalities. One worker on the ground was also killed, raising the final death toll to 36. T</span>he disaster was the subject of spectacular newsreel coverage, and photographs, shattering public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the abrupt end of the airship era.</p> <p>Werner Franz, the 14-year-old cabin boy, was initially dazed by the realization that the ship was on fire. As he stood near the officer's mess where he had been putting away dishes moments before, a water tank above him burst open, and he was suddenly soaked to the skin. Not only did this snap him back to his senses, as he later told interviewers, but it also put out the fire around him. He then made his way to a nearby hatch through which the kitchen had been provisioned before the flight, and dropped through it just as the forward part of the ship was briefly rebounding into the air. He began to run toward the starboard side, but stopped and turned around and ran the other way, because the flames were being pushed by the wind in that same direction. He made it clear of the wreck with no injuries, and lived to be the last surviving crew member when he died at age 92 on August 13, 2014.</p> <p style=""text-align: center"">Â </p> <p>Â </p> <div style=""text-align: center""><object classid=""clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"" codebase=""http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"" height=""350"" width=""425""><param name=""width"" value=""425""/><param name=""height"" value=""350""/><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/dsWAGg7j1lE""/><embed height=""350"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/dsWAGg7j1lE"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""425""/></object></div> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p>  ",1937,500,0,FALSE,3860,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F863CDED-1517-6111-28DDC1036E8A57B8.jpg,

Assigned to Hollywood's newly formed ""First Motion Picture Unit,"" Gable's efforts making patriotic propaganda films were a valuable contribution to troop morale. In 1943 he filmed <em>Combat America</em> in Great Britain, recounting the experiences of the 351st Bombardment Group of the U.S. Army Air Forces based in England, even seeing many combat missions himself.</p> <p>During World War II the U.S. Naval Aid AuxiliaryÂ (NAA) set upÂ a series of stations across the country to provide entertainment and temporary housing for servicemen and sailors during their rotation from one location to another, counting on volunteers to keep the food and services flowing. Kitchen help, musicians, typists, medical aides, file clerks, servers-the list of needed talents was endless. It was a different age, and Americans all across the country readily responded to that need, volunteering their time to help the war effort. </p> <p>The NAA received a good deal of their funding from public donations, much of which was raised by many of Hollywood's brightest stars, and by 1944 the NAA had signed up almost 200 celebrities who had already dedicated hundreds of hours working in the stations and giving their time in personal appearances across the country. Signing these specially prepared autograph cards as a fund raiser was something they could do that took very little time, and they were greeted enthusiastically by a ready public.

Carole Lombard may have been the first to suggest that he play Rhett Butler (and she play Scarlett) when she bought him a copy of the bestseller, which he refused to read.<br/><br/>Gable was an almost immediate favorite for the role of Rhett with both the public and producer David O. Selznick. But as Selznick had no male stars under long-term contract, he needed to go through the process of negotiating to borrow an actor from another studio. Gary Cooper was Selznick's first choice. When Cooper turned down the role, he was quoted as saying, ""<em>Gone With the Wind</em> is going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I'm glad it'll be Clark Gable who's falling flat on his nose, not me."" By then, Selznick was determined to get Gable, and eventually found a way to borrow him from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Gable was wary of potentially disappointing a public who had decided no one else could play the part. He later conceded, ""I think I know now how a fly must react after being caught in a spider's web."" It was his first film in Technicolor. Also appearing in <em>Gone With The Wind</em> in the role of ""Aunt Pittypat"" was Laura Hope Crews, the friend in Portland who had coaxed Gable back into the theater.<br/><br/>Gable also reportedly was friends with African-American actress Hattie McDaniel, and even slipped her a real drink during the scene they were supposed to be celebrating the birth of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter. Gable also tried to boycott the Atlanta premiere because McDaniel was not allowed to attend, and only attended after she pleaded him to go. He remained friends with McDaniel and always attended her Hollywood parties, especially when she was fundraising for the World War II effort.<br/><br/>Gable didn't want to shed tears for the scene after Scarlett (Leigh) has a miscarriage. Olivia de Havilland made him cry, later commenting, ""... Oh, he would not do it. He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level. We had done it without him weeping several times and then we had one last try. I said, ""You can do it, I know you can do it and you will be wonderful ..."" Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up at his eyes and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it.""<br/><br/>Decades later, Gable said that whenever his career would start to fade, a re-release of <em>Gone with the Wind</em> would instantly revive everything, and he continued as a top leading man for the rest of his life. <em>Gone with the Wind</em> was given theatrical re-releases in 1947, 1954, 1961, 1967 (in a widescreen version), 1971, 1989, and 1998.

A naturally talented inventor since he was 21, Gatling invented the Gatling gun after he noticed early in the American Civil War that a majority of the dead were lost to disease rather than gunshots. In 1857, he wrote: <em>""It occurred to me that if I could invent a machineâa gunâwhich could by its rapidity of fire, enable one man to do as much battle duty as a hundred, that it would, to a large extent supersede the necessity of large armies, and consequently, exposure to battle and disease [would] be greatly diminished.""</em></p> <p align=""center"">Â <img alt=""Gatling Gun"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_34616BD4-1517-6111-2868256A22FEE4FC.jpg"" title=""Gatling Gun"" width=""379""/></p>   <p>After developing and demonstrating a working prototype, in 1862 he founded the Gatling Gun Company in Indianapolis, Indiana to market the gun. The first 6 production guns were destroyed during a fire in December 1862 at the factory where they had been manufactured at Gatling's expense. Undaunted, Gatling arranged for another 13 to be manufactured at the Cincinnati Type Factory. While General Benjamin F. Butler bought 12 and Admiral David Dixon Porter bought one, it wasnât until 1866 that the US Government officially purchased Gatling guns. In 1870 he sold his patents for the Gatling gun to Colt. Gatling remained president of the Gatling Gun Company until it was fully absorbed by Colt in 1897. The hand-cranked Gatling gun was declared obsolete by the United States Army in 1911.</p>   <p>In his later years, Gatling patented inventions to improve toilets, bicycles, steam-cleaning of raw wool, pneumatic power, and many other fields. World-famous, he was elected as the first president of the American Association of Inventors and Manufacturers in 1891, serving for six years. Although still quite wealthy at the time of his death, he had made and lost several fortunes in bad investments.</p>  ",,450,0,FALSE,3404,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8BEF63A3-1517-6111-28EC670B08D4DF57.jpg,

As can be seen at the link, while Cowan's item was in better condition,  this appears to be only the second such Geronimo drawing known to come  to market in recent history, making it an exceptionally rare artifact  from the highly regarded Native American warrior. </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>Geronimo</strong> (1829-1909) was a Chiricahua  military leader who was believed by his followers to have some spiritual  ""powers,"" such as the ability to walk without leaving tracks and to  survive gunshots. He led raids on both sides of the Southwestern border,  eluding capture by both the Mexican and U.S. Armies for nearly three  decades. He is often considered the last ""hold out,"" refusing to  recognize American occupation of the region, and leading an independent  band of native people. <br/><br/>Geronimo was finally captured in 1886 by a  troop of the 4th Cavalry led by Captain Henry Lawton under General  Nelson Miles. Geronimo himself gave credit to 1st. Lieut. Charles  Gatewood, whom he knew and who spoke some Apache, as being the person  who convinced him to surrender, but Lawton gave credit to a number of  his men, and, of course, many others claimed the feat over the years.  Geronimo would spend the remainder of his life as a prisoner of war.  After he was moved to Fort Sill, OK in 1894, Geronimo was given some  freedom. </p> <p>He quickly understood commercialism and he became his own best PR man as he realized the value of all things connected with him. His appearances generated much interest at the Omaha Exposition of 1898, the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, the <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">St. Louis World's Fair in 1904</a>, Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration parade in 1905, numerous Wild West shows, and other public events. Promoters of these events had to appeal to the War Department to obtain permission for his appearance. At many of the events Geronimo would sell his autograph, photographs of himself as well as bows and arrows. In his autobiography, Geronimo talks about his experience at the St. Louis World's fair, ""I often made as much as two dollars a day, and when I returned I had plenty of money Â­ more than I had ever owned before. I am glad I went to the Fair."" </p> <p>At some point in his captivity, Geronimo  learned to read a bit and  write his name, and later even embraced  Christianity. His writing  always had a child-like quality, and he  preferred pencil to pen. He  seemed to like to embellish his signature,  sometimes putting designs in  the ""G,"" often filling in the ""O's,"" as in  this signature. Sometimes  all letters were serifed, sometimes only a few  were. </p> <p>Contrary to this supposed life of leisure Geronimo and the Apache people suffered both physically and mentally. During their stay in Florida and Alabama many Apaches died of tuberculosis and other diseases. Throughout the time spent as a prisoner of war, Geronimo never stopped asking to be allowed to return to his homeland in the Southwest. He died a prisoner of war at Fort Sills. </p> <p><img alt=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2ED01AA5-1517-6111-28A69F54C084AEB7.png"" title=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" width=""244""/><br/><em>Geronimo in the Indian Village at the 1901<br/>Pan American Exposition, Buffalo, New York.<br/>Image from the Library of Congress.</em></p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

This autograph was obtained in person while Rain-in-the-Face was a participant in one of several ""cultural villages"" featured in the Exposition reflecting peoples from around the world.<br/></strong></p>   <p>The World's Columbian Exposition (also called The Chicago World's Fair), was held in Chicago in 1893, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World. The fair had a profound and lasting effect on architecture, the arts, Chicago's self-image, and American industrial optimism. The Exposition covered more than 600 acres, featuring nearly 200 new buildings of classical architecture, canals and lagoons, and people and cultures from around the world. Over 27 million people (equivalent to about half the U.S. population at the time) attended the Exposition during its six-month run. Its scale and grandeur far exceeded the other world fairs, and it became a symbol of then-emerging American Exceptionalism.</p>   <p><strong>This remarkable historical artifact has been affixed onto a page of a large format (10"" x 12"") souvenir book of the 1893 World's Fair, presented entirely in the German language, featuring detailed descriptions of the buildings, architecture, and exhibitions displayed throughout the Exposition. The particular page shown in the photos here, to which the ticket has been affixed, features ""Sitting Bull's Cabin""âthe actual cabin the great Sioux chief died in. During the Exposition, according to the book ""Dedicatory and opening ceremonies of the World's Columbian exposition: historical and descriptive (Memorial Volume),"": <em>""...Sitting Bull's Cabin was filled with a number of Indians, including Rain-in-the-Face. War dances were given daily."" </em></strong>In the photo to the left, Rain-in-the-Face is the Indian figure standing without a hat, next to the fence. The entire souvenir book, approximately an inch thick, is included in this offering, providing further rock-solid provenance from the period itself.</p>   <p><strong>Also affixed to the page is a curious period newspaper article describing a knife wound Rain-in-the-Face suffered at the hands of a vengeful Sioux squaw, noting the chief was near death at the time. </strong>The Admission Ticket was personally signed by Chief Rain-in-the-Face for Swiss businessman M. Grimmer, whose nephew noted enthusiastically on the page next to the autograph: <em>""Signature of Chief 'Rain in the Face'. He killed Gen. Custer at Little Big Horn. My uncle met this Indian personally at the 1893 World Fair!""</em> A signed letter of provenance accompanies this outstanding item, furnished by the agent who acquired the memorabilia directly from the Grimmer family in Switzerland. We also obtained a beautiful, authentic <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">Geronimo</a> autograph from this same source, which recently sold at auction. </p>   <p>This is a truly historic, one-of-a-kind memento from one of the most feared and respected Native American warriors of the late 19th century, of which few authentic exemplars have survived. Rain-in-the-Face is among the rarest of Americana signatures, far more difficult to find than Geronimo or Sitting Bull. We know of only two other offerings that have been on the market in many years.

He was among the Indian leaders who defeated General George Armstrong Custer and the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment at the 1876 Battle of Little Big Horn.</p> <p>Born in the Dakota Territory near the forks of the Cheyenne River about 1835, Rain-in-the-Face was from the Hunkpapa band within the Lakota nation. He first fought against the whites in the summer of 1866 when he participated in a raid against Fort Totten in what is now North Dakota. In 1868, he again fought the U.S. Army in the Fetterman massacre near Fort Phil Kearny in present-day Montana. He again was on the warpath during the Black Hills War, leading a raid near the Tongue River in which two white civilians accompanying Custer's cavalry were killed. He returned to the Standing Rock Reservation, but was captured by Custer after being betrayed by reservation Indians. He was taken to Fort Abraham Lincoln and incarcerated. However, he was freed by a sympathetic soldier and returned to the reservation, then fled to the Powder River. In the spring of 1876, he joined Sitting Bull and traveled with him to the Little Big Horn River in early June.</p>   <p>During the subsequent fighting on Custer Hill on June 25, Rain-in-the-Face is alleged to have cut the heart out of Thomas Custer, a feat that was popularized by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in <em>The Revenge of Rain in the Face</em>. According to legend, Tom Custer had unjustly imprisoned Rain-in-the-Face. Some contemporary accounts also claimed that the war chief had personally dispatched George Custer as well, but in the confused fighting, a number of similar claims have been attributed to other warriors. Late in his life, in a conversation with writer Charles Eastman, Rain-in-the-Face denied killing George Custer or mutilating Tom Custer.</p>   <p>Rain-in-the-Face died in his home at the Bullhead Station on the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota, reportedly after a lengthy illness.</p> <p><img alt=""Rain-in-the-Face"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_0B6F513B-3048-C0CE-55278E8F2860CA19.jpg"" title=""Rain-in-the-Face"" width=""250""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Geronimo,Geronimo,,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904/,Signed Hand-Drawn Sketch,"  <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>Geronimo signed and hand-drawn sketch of a figure believed to represent a <em>gaan</em>  dancer, with headdress, feathers dangling from his upper arms, and a  wand in each hand. The figure even has ""cactus kickers"" on his  moccasins.</strong> This 3.75"" x 6"" drawing is backed with watermarked paper such as is commonly used for book endpapers. Small tear lower right that does not extend into drawing or signature.  Minor surface stains, some of which appear to be water staining.  <br/><br/>A nearly identical version of this signed drawing was sold in June 2008 by <a href=""http://www.cowanauctions.com/past_sales_view_item.asp?ItemId=61379"" target=""_blank"">Cowan's Auction House</a>, well-known experts in fine American Indian and Western art, where owner Wes Cowan (who is also an appraiser on PBS's <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>) estimated its value upwards of $20,000.  As can be seen at the link, while Cowan's item was in better condition,  this appears to be only the second such Geronimo drawing known to come  to market in recent history, making it an exceptionally rare artifact  from the highly regarded Native American warrior. </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>Geronimo</strong> (1829-1909) was a Chiricahua  military leader who was believed by his followers to have some spiritual  ""powers,"" such as the ability to walk without leaving tracks and to  survive gunshots. He led raids on both sides of the Southwestern border,  eluding capture by both the Mexican and U.S. Armies for nearly three  decades. He is often considered the last ""hold out,"" refusing to  recognize American occupation of the region, and leading an independent  band of native people. <br/><br/>Geronimo was finally captured in 1886 by a  troop of the 4th Cavalry led by Captain Henry Lawton under General  Nelson Miles. Geronimo himself gave credit to 1st. Lieut. Charles  Gatewood, whom he knew and who spoke some Apache, as being the person  who convinced him to surrender, but Lawton gave credit to a number of  his men, and, of course, many others claimed the feat over the years.  Geronimo would spend the remainder of his life as a prisoner of war.  After he was moved to Fort Sill, OK in 1894, Geronimo was given some  freedom. </p> <p>He quickly understood commercialism and he became his own best PR man as he realized the value of all things connected with him. His appearances generated much interest at the Omaha Exposition of 1898, the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, the <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">St. Louis World's Fair in 1904</a>, Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration parade in 1905, numerous Wild West shows, and other public events. Promoters of these events had to appeal to the War Department to obtain permission for his appearance. At many of the events Geronimo would sell his autograph, photographs of himself as well as bows and arrows. In his autobiography, Geronimo talks about his experience at the St. Louis World's fair, ""I often made as much as two dollars a day, and when I returned I had plenty of money Â­ more than I had ever owned before. I am glad I went to the Fair."" </p> <p>At some point in his captivity, Geronimo  learned to read a bit and  write his name, and later even embraced  Christianity. His writing  always had a child-like quality, and he  preferred pencil to pen. He  seemed to like to embellish his signature,  sometimes putting designs in  the ""G,"" often filling in the ""O's,"" as in  this signature. Sometimes  all letters were serifed, sometimes only a few  were. </p> <p>Contrary to this supposed life of leisure Geronimo and the Apache people suffered both physically and mentally. During their stay in Florida and Alabama many Apaches died of tuberculosis and other diseases. Throughout the time spent as a prisoner of war, Geronimo never stopped asking to be allowed to return to his homeland in the Southwest. He died a prisoner of war at Fort Sills. </p> <p><img alt=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2ED01AA5-1517-6111-28A69F54C084AEB7.png"" title=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" width=""244""/><br/><em>Geronimo in the Indian Village at the 1901<br/>Pan American Exposition, Buffalo, New York.<br/>Image from the Library of Congress.</em></p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Though he learned and spoke English fairly well, anything written or signed by Iron Tail is exceedingly scarce and rarely comes to market. Accompanied by an actual vintage photograph </strong><strong>showing Iron Tail in a tribal dance </strong><strong>(approx 2 inches square) taken by the original Swiss collector who obtained the signed drawing </strong><strong>personally at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show circa 1900; plus two</strong><strong> vintage postcards of Iron Tail in regalia, and of his squaws with papooses at the Wild West Show. Provenance included in original album containing other unknown autographs gathered by this </strong><strong>European collector, from whose estate we have acquired many historic and authentically signed items.</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>IRON TAIL</strong> (1857-1955) (aka <em>Sinte Maza</em> and <em>Wasu Maza</em>, among other variations) was an Oglala Sioux (Lakota). He fought under Crazy Horse in 1876 at the Battle of Little Bighorn when he was just eighteen years old. Little Bighorn was a victory for the Sioux but shortly after the battle, Iron Tail followed Chief Sitting Bull into exile in Canada. They surrendered to US forces at Fort Buford in July of 1881, were pardoned, and allowed to settle on the Great Sioux Reservation of South Dakota with promises of peace and non-interference.Â  In February of 1890, the United States government dissolved the Great Sioux Reservation.</p> <p>In an effort to break tribal identity, individuals were forced to farm on 320 acre family plots and children were sent away to government schools that forbid any inclusion of traditional culture and language. This same period was marked by a severe drought that decimated crops and livestock.Â  In response, many of the desperate Sioux embraced a religious movement known as the Ghost Dance. The unity of the Ghost Dancers frightened the Bureau of Indian Affairs and military troops were dispatched to quell what US officials saw as a brewing Indian revolution. Tensions came to a head in December 1890 when Sitting Bull was killed during an arrest attempt on the Standing Rock reservation. A group of Ghost Dancers fled to join Chief Big Foot (Sitting Bull's half-brother) on the Cheyenne River Reservation where Iron Tail and his family were also living at that time. Big Foot tried to move to the Pine Ridge Agency where Chief Red Cloud could broker a negotiated surrender, but the Army surrounded the group at Wounded Knee Creek. Approximately 150 Lakota died in the fighting, another 150 died of exposure and 25 U.S. troops also perished. Iron Tail was severely wounded and lost his mother, father, two brothers, sister, and wife in the massacre, and his infant son who died a short time later.  </p>   <p>After Wounded Knee, Iron Tail settled near Kyle on the Pine Ridge Reservation.Â  Eventually he found employment with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/william-f-cody-buffalo-bill-double-signed-autograph-signatures-cabinet-card"">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>'s Wild West Show.Â  Cody had many ties to the Sioux tribe, especially at the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock Agencies. Chief Sitting Bull toured with the show in 1885.Â  During those performances he famously ""blessed"" audiences, cursing them in the Lakota language to clamorous applause. Sitting Bull returned to Standing Rock at the end of that season but Cody continued to hire Sioux performers almost exclusively, including such prominent figures as <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-autographed-hand-drawn-signed-self-portrait-sketch-1901-signature"">Geronimo</a> and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rain-in-the-face-signature-autograph-signed-1893-columbian-exposition-custer-little-big-horn"">Rain-in-the-Face</a>. Iron Tail traveled throughout Europe and the United States with the Wild West show for nearly 15 years as a marquee attraction and became a close friend of Cody, who often proclaimed that, <em>""Iron Tail is the finest man I have ever known, bar none.""</em></p> Many of the Native Americans who found employment in the various Wild West Shows eventually returned home and used the skills and insights they had gained to improve the still desperate situation on the reservations.Â  Iron Tail had some powerful friends in William Cody and General Nelson A. Miles, whom he had met during the Army investigations of the Wounded Knee massacre. With their support, he traveled to Washington, DC around the turn of the century to seek reparations for the victims. While in Washington he sat for sculptor James Earle Fraser as one of three models for the visage found on the Indian Head nickel that was released in 1913.  <p>Â <img alt=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" height=""204"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_6279706E-1517-6111-28537926D52D3747.jpg"" title=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" width=""410""/></p>   <p>On the same trip, Iron Tail also met the Battle of Manila Bay hero Admiral George Dewey. When the Chief later converted to Catholicism he adopted the name Dewey Beard in honor of the General. Iron Tail, now Dewey Beard, remarried and had a son, became a rancher and raised horses, but still he remained a showman. He had parts in some ""westerns"" including Cody's silent film about Wounded Knee. Up until the last years of his life, he performed at regional powwows and tourist venues and used his visibility to speak out against the mistreatment of Native Americans. </p> <p>The following exemplar of a strikingly similar original signed drawing by Iron Tail appears in the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Bills-Wild-West-Warriors/dp/0061129771/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266882496&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude KÃ¤sebier</em></strong></a> by Michelle Delaney, Â© 2007 Smithsonian Institution (Collins, New York: 2007):</p> <p><img alt=""Iron Tail Drawing Exemplar"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_F80DCCF2-1517-6111-2873D9177EB86780.jpg"" title=""Iron Tail Drawing Exemplar"" width=""273""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

""BUFFALO BILL""  CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and  showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of  Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the  American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with  cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody  got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply  Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the  nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a  soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third  Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs,  including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony  Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a  hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which  were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for  his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872  Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack  Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original  Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season,  Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok  to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's  part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where  he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge  for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody  put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of  entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded  ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word  ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that  toured annually.</p> <p>  In 1893 the title was  changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of  the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with  participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other  military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in  their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and  Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and  colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events,  feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western  personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a  band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well  known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband  Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of  Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the  riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and   stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed   General Custer.</p> <p><strong>GORDON WILLIAM LILLIE</strong> (1860-1942) became famous as the Wild  West showman and performer <em><strong>Pawnee Bill</strong></em>.</p>   <p>In 1888  Lillie and his wife, May, launched their own Wild West show: ""Pawnee  Bill's Historic Wild West"". May starred in the show as the ""Champion  Girl Horseback Shot of the West."" Their first season was a financial  disaster. They re-organized as a smaller operation called ""Pawnee Bill's  Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show."" The show was  popular but not lucrative. Gordon Lillie added Jose Barrera to the cast;  he was widely popular performing as ""Mexican Joe"". In 1907 Lillie hired  performers from a variety of backgrounds. The show included Mexican  cowboys, Pawnee Indians, Japanese performers, and Arab jugglers. The  ensemble debuted as ""Pawnee Bill's Great Far East Show."" In 1908 Pawnee  Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the ""Two Bills' Show"".  That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.

A classic image of  Cody dressed in a fringed and beaded buckskin jacket with his long  curly hair flowing from beneath his hat. The verso is facsimile ink-stamped ""Yours  truly, W. F. Cody"".</strong><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>WILLIAM  FREDERICK ""BUFFALO BILL"" CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).  </p> <strong></strong> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs, including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872 Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season, Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that toured annually.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In 1893 the title was changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events, feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and  stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic  re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed  General Custer.</p>  ",c1880s,sold,1,FALSE,3452,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/52AF4B50-3048-C0CE-55427B56937B915F.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/73CCE217-1517-6111-28AEAC67D8664117.jpg",

His New York Tribune was America's most influential newspaper from the 1840s to the 1870s and ""established Greeley's reputation as the greatest editor of his day."" Greeley used it to promote the Whig and Republican parties, as well as opposition to slavery and a host of reforms, including advocacy of a national homestead act (famous for the slogan, ""<strong><em>Go west, young man</em></strong>""). Crusading against the corruption of Ulysses S. Grant's Republican administration, he was the new Liberal Republican Party's candidate in the 1872 U.S. presidential election. Despite having the additional support of the Democratic Party, he lost in a landslide. He is currently the only presidential candidate who has died during the electoral process.<strong></strong></p> <p><strong>William Atkinson</strong> was the author of <em>Principles of Political Economy</em>, published by Horace Greeley (Greeley &amp; McElrath: New York, 1843); Greeley also wrote the Introduction to the book.</p> <p><img alt=""Horace Greeley"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_3F803C9B-1517-6111-288725B9EAB7152F.jpg"" title=""Horace Greeley"" width=""278""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Inscribed to his friend, the artist Roberto Domingo y FallolaâSpain's most famous painter of bullfights, and whose painting illustrates the cover of Hemingway's book  <em>Death in the Afternoon</em> âthe inscription reads: <blockquote><p><em>Pamplona<br/>Dear: Roberto / [Retreat?]<br/></em><em>You Papa<br/></em><em>Ernest Hemingway â47</em></p></blockquote> <p>Accompanied by letter of provenance establishing authenticity. This photograph is also featured on the official <a href=""http://robertodomingo.com/signed-photo-by-ernest-hemingway-1947/"" target=""_blank"">Roberto Domingo website</a>. Also shown in images (though not included) is a postcard that sold elsewhere, depicting Hemingway's cursive for ""Roberto"" and ""you papa"" in nearly identical form, provided as an exemplar helping to establish an otherwise difficult interpretation of his writing.</p> <p>Though it is unknown whether he was in Pamplona in 1947, that year was a significant one in the life of Ernest  Hemingway. In a small ceremony in June 1947, at the U.S. embassy in  Cuba, Hemingway was awarded a Bronze Star for his service as a war  correspondent for having circulated ""freely under fire in combat areas  in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions. Through his talent  of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture  of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his  organization in combat."" </p> <p>Hemingway became a bullfighting aficionado after seeing the Pamplona fiesta in the 1920s, which he wrote about in <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. In another book, <em>Death in the Afternoon</em>, Hemingway explored the metaphysics of bullfightingâthe ritualized, almost religious practiceâthat he considered analogous to the writer's search for meaning and the essence of life. In bullfighting, he found the elemental nature of life and death.</p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""text-align: center""><img height=""380"" src=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/79D0BFA2-1517-6111-28EF67B72E60D1A3.png"" width=""290""/></p> <p><em><br/>Death in the Afternoon</em> was published by Scribner's in September 1932. As eloquently described by Miriam B. Mandel in her book <em>A Companion to Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon</em> (Camden House, 2004):</p> <blockquote><p>""<strong>The most arresting feature of the dust jacket is the painting by Roberto Domingo</strong> (1883-1956). Under the word ""Toros"", a powerful looking bull is pursuing a banderillero who trails a swirling cape of yellow and magenta, as he leaps over the barerra into the confetti-colored crowd. So close is the man's escape that he seems to be helped over the fence by the bulls approaching horns. The man, however, is not the protagonist of the scene. The center of attention is the charging bullâa splendid animal, with a dappled gray body and a handsome black head outlined against the red barrera. There is power in the broad back and in the hump of muscle that surges up from behind his horns, there is speed in the splayed legs and sinuous line of the spine from neck to tail, and danger in the solid curves of the sharp horns.""</p></blockquote> <p><em>Toros</em> (1923) is an oil painting, one of 18 painted by Domingo between 1915 and 1942, to advertise bullfight festivals in Valencia. The original painting was acquired personally by Hemingway, and still dominates the parlor of his <em>Finca Vigia</em> home in San Francisco de Paula, Cuba (now a museum).</p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""text-align: center""><img height=""362"" src=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/79C4E6CB-1517-6111-28056463722BED9B.png"" width=""500""/></p> <p><br/>Any discussion concerning bullfighting would be incomplete without some mention of the controversy surrounding it. To that end Hemingway commented, ""Anything capable of arousing passion in its favor will surely raise as much passion against it.""</p> <p>As an aside, ""Death in the Afternoon"" also refers to a cocktail invented by Hemingway: ""Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly. Note: After six of these cocktails The Sun Also Rises.""</p>  ",1947,4500,0,FALSE,3519,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/E8DC8918-1517-6111-28EC45B2C5FD6D3E.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/73F549FA-1517-6111-28A1288562BCB50A.jpg",Roberto Domingo

Hotchner, Hemingwayâone of literature's most prominent atheistsâwas fond of good luck charms and carried numerous talismans throughout his life: a German belt buckle appropriated from a dead Nazi; a rabbit's foot; horse chestnuts he found in Paris; a piece of shrapnel removed from his leg in World War Iâand his cherished St. Christopher medal. It is unknown, but certainly likely, that Hemingway carried this with him during his reportage of the Spanish Civil War and World War I, as well as World War II.</p> <p>It was obviously of significant importance to him. In September 1959 Hemingway's pocket was picked for the third time in Spain, as he was signing autographs in Murcia while researching a series of bullfighting articles for <em>Life Magazine</em>. In a newspaper advertisement the next day, he sportingly appealed to the thief to return the wallet and the St. Christopher medal, but to keep the cash it contained as a tribute to the technical skill. The pickpocket accommodated Hemingway's plea, returning the wallet and the medal in a package delivered to the author's renowned friend, the famed bullfighter Antonio Ordonez. And, obligingly, the money was gone:</p> <p>Â <img alt=""Lodi News Sentinel September 1955"" height=""387"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8817467A-1517-6111-2850FA76ADDEC4D7.png"" title=""Lodi News Sentinel September 1955"" width=""258""/></p> <p>As you can see in the images, Hemingway had the St. Christopher medal  fashioned into a crude but functional money clip, likely crafted by a  Cuban artisan while at his Finca Vigia farm on the outskirts of Havana.  Though still remarkably detailed given its age, the faces of the figures are somewhat worn from years of use, but the  clear inscription on the back speaks to Hemingway's fondness for the man  who counseled him through two previous attempts at suicide; who monitored his high blood pressure daily in Ketchum,  Idaho; and who ultimately served as one of the pallbearers when the  great writer died.</p> <p>This extraordinary Hemingway artifact is truly a one-of-a-kind treasure, accompanied by a rock solid provenance from the estate of George Saviers, the ""country doctor"" widely known as an intimate friend and hunting companion of Ernest Hemingway during the last years of his life.</p> <p><img alt=""Gary Cooper - Ernest Hemingway - Tillie Arnold - George Saviers"" height=""313"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/880A4F82-1517-6111-28A1058EBF203545.png"" title=""Gary Cooper - Ernest Hemingway - Tillie Arnold - George Saviers"" width=""413""/><br/><em>Â Gary Cooper, Hemingway, Tillie Arnold &amp; Dr. George SaviersâSun Valley 1948<br/>Â Courtesy the Estate of George Saviers</em><br/> </p> <p>In the fall of 1960 Hemingway was admitted to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, ostensibly for treatment of high blood pressure but in reality for a more robust treatment of the severe depression that his wife Mary could no longer handle on her own. To avoid publicity, he was registered under the name ""George Saviers."" Tragically, his treatment at the Mayo Clinic would ultimately lead to electroshock therapy, resulting in loss of memory, a devastating outcome for Hemingway. Without his memory he could no longer write, could no longer recall essential facts and images. Writing, which had already become difficult while dealing with depression, was now nearly impossible. Less than a year later, Hemingway took his own lifeâwithin six months of giving this very St. Christopher medal to his friend George Saviers.</p>  ",1961,sold,1,FALSE,3593,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8803E771-1517-6111-285E2292B518857B.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/88043EF7-1517-6111-281C6B7DD71A73E8.png",
 Ernest Hemingway, Ernest,Hemingway,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/ernest-hemingway-the-fifth-column-signed-first-edition/,"Signed First Edition ""The Fifth Column""","  <p>Unusually scarce signed First Edition of Ernest Hemingway's <em>The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories</em>, published in 1938. Second state identical to the first printing of just 5,350 copies, this issue lacking only the letter ""A"" but bearing the Scribner's colophon seal on the copyright page. With new facsimile dust jacket in Mylar (identical to missing original DJ), ensconced in a custom scarlett clamshell case with embossed cover impressions. Overall the book is in Very Good+ condition, clean throughout but for common darkening on the inside edges of the end papers, otherwise fairly tight, with virtually no shelf wear. Dark red boards front and back, spine lightly sunned but gold on black titling still very strong. Hemingway's facsimile signature appears on cover.</p> <p>There are two rather ascerbic inscriptions on the first free end paper. The main one, of course, is handwritten by Hemingway himself, and reads:</p> <blockquote><p><em>""Dear Kit Bryan:<br/>Fortunately I never saw it<br/>But I wish we could have<br/>had the evening together!<br/>Â Â Â Â Â  Ernest Hemingway""</em></p></blockquote> <p>With thanks to our friend Charles Scribnerâand his always welcome sleuthing when dealing with the most enduring books of his family's publishing houseâhe offered a few insights into the stage play for which this book was titled:</p> <blockquote><p><em>""I can offer these clues: the inscriptions clearly refer to the short-lived Theatre Guild production of 'The Fifth Column' on Broadway [March 6 to May 18, 1940]Â as the date by 'CS' is 5 April, a month into the run, and he [Hemingway] clearly did not like the performanceâbut considers the book an effective antidote!Â Hemingway's later [so it seems since the play closed in May] inscription mentions the fact that he 'fortunately' never saw <a href=""http://www.playbillvault.com/Show/Detail/946/The-Fifth-Column"" target=""_blank"">the Broadway production</a>âbut clearly Kit Bryan did and so he adds 'But I wish we could have had the evening together'âvery gracious!""</em></p></blockquote> <p>The inscription above Hemingway's remains a bit of a mystery, although Charles has ruled out the writing as being in the hand of either his father or his grandfather, thus eliminating the possibility of <em>""C.S.""</em> being either of the former Charles Scribners. But this particular inscription is telling in other ways:</p> <blockquote><p><em>""To get the taste<br/>out of your mouth.<br/>Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  C.S.<br/>Â Â Â  ce 5 avril, 1940.""</em></p></blockquote> <p>Our best guess, then, would be that the elusive ""C.S."" had obtained this signed copy of the book directly from its author, for his or her friend ""Kit Bryan"" who likely concurred with Hemingway's critique of the production, and who might better appreciate the story in its original form. And since Hemingway expressed his wish to have had the evening together, it's possible the author knew the recipient, though we could find no mention of the name in any of Hemingway's letters nor among the <a href=""http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/The-Ernest-Hemingway-Collection.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Hemingway archives at the JFK Library</a>.</p> <p><em>The Fifth Column</em> was the only full-length play Ernest Hemingway had written, working on it while he was a correspondent covering the Spanish Civil War in 1937. The play takes its name from Franco's remark that he had four columns advancing on Madrid and a fifth column of loyalists inside the city ready to attack from the rear. <em>The Fifth Column</em> is not about Franco sympathizers, however, but about an American war correspondent who is a secret agent for the Republicans, and Hemingway worked on it while holed up in the Hotel Florida with all the other war correspondents. (This particular scene was robustly portrayed in the 2012 film <em>Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn</em>, by the way.)</p>  ",1938,sold,1,FALSE,3768,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/782905D7-1517-6111-28AC09075B617AFE.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/782B7DFC-1517-6111-28F0269595774727.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/782C5D9E-1517-6111-28043C66308DC0CB.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/782D3233-1517-6111-2825ED547A3C297E.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/95655706-1517-6111-285364F0B90EC3AB.jpg",

This letter, dated July 19, 1954 on Hemingway's personal Finca Vigia, San Francisco De Paula, Cuba stationery, is dated just six months after Hemingway and his wife, Mary, were <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/docs/nytimes-012654.pdf"" target=""_blank"">nearly killed in a plane crash </a>in the elephant country of Uganda while on safariâtheir second plane crash in 48 hours! Hemingway suffered a ruptured kidney, a sprained arm and leg, crushed vertebrae, a paralyzed sphincter, burnt scalp and a temporary loss of hearing and eyesight. He and Mary were erroneously reported dead in many newspapers around the world. Hemingway even had the unique pleasure of reading his obituary days later, very much alive, in a cafe in Venice, Italy.</p> <p>Written to his good friend, author/screenwriter Peter Viertel while Hemingway was recuperating, it reads in full (including misspellings; see below for elaboration on notable references):</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Dear Pete: </strong></p><p><strong>Thanks very much for the letters and the telephone call. I've sent the dope to Rice. Paul Kohner wrote yest[erday] too and said he would get in touch with Rice after he had been with John</strong><strong>. Had a letter from John and will write him. He didn't say much only that he was still figuring on doing it and what was the best way.</strong></p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p><strong>Leland called and I said what we'd agreed; Zinnerman best; better to do Old Man later and with him; same as you said and wrote. Leland wants you to do the script. Has somebody else who has done something which will turn over to you. No dates specified. He seemed sort of cooled on Spence; maybe everybody has. It all sounded as though put-off was The Word. I think it is just as well. None of us want to do it right now and I'm not in shape yet.</strong></p></blockquote>   <blockquote><p><strong>What gives with Ava [Gardner] and L.M.? Riddle me that one. </strong></p><p><strong>Kohner said John would like to make a picture out of Death In The Afternoon. You should be getting valuable experience now to write a script for it. Don't catch kidney stones. </strong></p><p><strong>Mary is fine, healthy and cheerful and happy (or was until she had to go [o]ver see her father on the last swing around with that disease Winchell wiped out). She's had an awful time there in Gulfport and she was just getting in really fine shape. The father won't take medecine, won't obey doctors and wants 24 hr. nursing service from Mary. She has them both in a nursing home now. The father wouldn't stay in the hospital. She's due back late tomorrow night.</strong></p><p><strong>How's your bursitis. I have lion fat that is supposed to be good for anything like that. Do you want me to send some. You rub it on and in but maybe it is good if you eat it too. </strong></p><p><strong>Everything about me is clearing up good. Have the blood pressure down to 160 over 70 and it will get further down. Kidneys functioning good. Liver same. They put me on a normal diet and said to drink according to my own judgement. Only thing is I am slow and tire easier than I should. But that is natural and I will train out of it. </strong></p><p><strong>Haven't heard a thing about how Pamplona came out. You probably heard from L.M. since Antonio was fighting. Will probably get the bull papers this week.</strong></p><p><strong>It has been hot as hell but every place else worse. Sitting here in a hot July probably accounts for lack of pep, too. Pool wonderful and cool and have been swimming and exercising regularly. When you come down will put you in some big fish. Haven't been out yet as the big ones are running and I didn't want to do anything stupid with back.</strong></p><p><strong>Hope we can make a good deal on Across.</strong></p><p><strong>Excuse dull letter Pete. No news nor scandal here. Nothing but going through old check stubs and cancelled checks and looking for receipts etc. to get to Rice on Aug. 1st so he will have final gen for 1953 ultimate up or down revision on Income Tax. Paid the two first 1954 installments on July 15th. They had given me an extension on acct. of the crashes etc. Then on Aug 15 will pay whatever the 1953 adjustment is. Then on Sept. 15 can look forward to digging up another installment on 1954. I liked it better in Hurtgen or up at Laitokitok or at the shamba. Much better at the shamba; Kwenda na shamba."" </strong></p><p><strong>Give our love to Bettina.</strong></p><p><strong>Best always,<br/> Papa</strong></p></blockquote>   <p>This letter is full of rich references to prominent Hemingway associations: <strong>Peter Viertel</strong> wrote the screenplays for <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> and <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>; <strong>Alfred Rice</strong> was Hemingway's tax attorney (the writer was plagued by extraordinarily onerous US income tax obligations, payments for which he alludes to later in the letter); ""<strong>John</strong>"" is likely either <strong>Sturges </strong>or <strong>Huston </strong>here, as both were involved with Kohner and Hemingway at the time; <strong>Paul Kohner </strong>was the most important agent in Hollywood at the time, with clients such as Ingmar Bergman, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, and John Huston (who introduced Kohner to Hemingway);   <strong>Leland Hayward</strong> was a powerful Hollywood agent and the producer the 1958 version of <em>The Old Man and the Sea, </em>which was directed by <strong>John Sturges</strong>, with <strong>Fred Zinnemann</strong> as an uncredited director; <strong>Spence[r] Tracy</strong> starred in 1958's <em>The Old Man and the </em>Sea; <strong>Ava Gardner</strong>, one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, was a close friend of Hemingway, and ""<strong>L.M.</strong>"" refers to the famous Spanish bullfighter <strong>Luis Miguel DominguÃ­n</strong>, with whom Ava had a sensational affair in the early 1950sâwhile she was married to Frank Sinatra. Spanish matador <strong>Antonio Ordonez</strong> was DominguÃ­n's brother-in-law and main rival in the bullring, and of course <strong>Pamplona </strong>is famed for their annual Running of the Bulls celebration. The discussion of Hemingway's health is notable since he was still recovering from serious injuries resulting from the plane crash, and was giving Viertel a condition update. <strong>Walter Winchell </strong>was one of America's most prominent newspaper and radio commentators, and the <strong>disease </strong>referred to is polio (Winchell had spread rumors that the government had ""a stock of little white coffins"" for the children  who would die as a result of their involvement in the Salk vaccine trials, which of course proved not to be the caseâthough he had nothing to do with its obliteration); ""<strong>Across</strong>"" refers to Hemingway's novel, <em>Across the River and Into the Trees</em>, a book generally regarded by critics as the low-water mark of Hemingway's career and which never saw the big screen. <strong>Hertgen </strong>is the Hertgen Forest in Germany, a World War II landmark, and <strong>Loitokitok </strong>is a small town in Kenya, in the shadow of Mount Kilimanjaro where Hemingway spent much time. <strong>Kwenda na shamba</strong> is a reference to <em>True at First Light</em>, a posthumously-released safari story. The famous French model <strong>Bettina</strong> was Peter Viertel's mistress, having abandoned his pregnant wife Jigee for her (but eventually marrying actress Deborah Kerr).</p>   <p>Three months after this letter was written, Ernest Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, and later guaranteed his renown by committing suicide in 1961.</p> <p>This letter comes with a signed Certificate of Authenticity issued by John Reznikoff of PSA/DNA.

Castro had since turned the home into a museum honoring the great writer, which stands to this day as Havana's most popular tourist attraction.</p> <strong>OSVALDO SALAS</strong>  (1914-1992) is widely recognized as having been one of the world's great press photographers. His international fame came not just from the quality of his work but also because he was so often in the right place at the right time. He received many awards, diplomas and honors for his photography, including being acclaimed, in 1983, an International Master of Photography by the International Press Association. <br/> <p>Roberto Salas </p> <p>Born in New York in 1940, <strong>ROBERTO SALAS</strong> has been living and working in Havana since 1959. Invited to Cuba personally by Fidel Castro, Roberto has documented the revolution from the Sierra Maestro to the Bay of Pigs, later serving as a U.N. correspondent and war correspondent in South East Asia, both in Cambodia and Vietnam, where he spent a year behind Vietcong lines. Like his father's, Roberto's images are beautifully crafted. His extraordinary ability to capture the humility and courage of the Cuban people during the momentous decades of the revolution is an invitation into the heart of Cuba.</p>  ",1960,sold,1,FALSE,3682,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D281AB26-1517-6111-28DD4FD0FA4164FB.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D2821799-1517-6111-28857D41510E678A.jpg",Roberto Salas
 Ernest Hemingway, Ernest,Hemingway,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/ernest-hemingway-selected-letters-signed-carlos-baker/,Signed Limited Edition of Hemingway's Selected Letters,"  <p><strong>A fine limited edition copy of <em>Ernest Hemingway's Selected Letters: 1917-1961</em>. Signed by editor Carlos Baker, #268 of 500 copies. In mint condition, protected by acetate dust jacket and brown silk slipcase with satin bookmark, signed by editor Carlos Baker. </strong>Minor shelfware at base, and silk run lines on sides as in photo of slipcase, else fine.<strong><br/></strong></p> <p>While many people are familiar with the public image of Hemingway and the legendary accounts of his life, few knew him as an intimate. With this collection of letters, presented for the first time as a Scribner Classic, a new Hemingway emerges. Ranging from 1917 to 1961, this generous selection of nearly six hundred letters is, in effect, both a self-portrait and an autobiography. In his own words, Hemingway candidly reveals himself to a wide variety of people: family, friends, enemies, editors, translators, and almost all the prominent writers of his day. In so doing he proves to be one of the most entertaining letter writers of all time.</p> <p>Carlos Baker has chosen letters that not only represent major turning points in Hemingway's career but also exhibit character, wit, and the writer's typical enthusiasm for hunting, fishing, drinking, and eating. A few are ingratiating, some downright truculent. Others present his views on writing and reading, criticize books by friend or foe, and discuss women, soldiers, politicians, and prizefighters. Perhaps more than anything, these letters show Hemingway's irrepressible humor, given far freer rein in his correspondence than in his books. An informal biography in letters, the product of forty-five years' living and writing, <em>Ernest Hemingway: Selected Letters</em> leaves an indelible impression of an extraordinary man. </p>

Though he learned and spoke English fairly well, anything written or signed by Iron Tail is exceedingly scarce and rarely comes to market. Accompanied by an actual vintage photograph </strong><strong>showing Iron Tail in a tribal dance </strong><strong>(approx 2 inches square) taken by the original Swiss collector who obtained the signed drawing </strong><strong>personally at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show circa 1900; plus two</strong><strong> vintage postcards of Iron Tail in regalia, and of his squaws with papooses at the Wild West Show. Provenance included in original album containing other unknown autographs gathered by this </strong><strong>European collector, from whose estate we have acquired many historic and authentically signed items.</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>IRON TAIL</strong> (1857-1955) (aka <em>Sinte Maza</em> and <em>Wasu Maza</em>, among other variations) was an Oglala Sioux (Lakota). He fought under Crazy Horse in 1876 at the Battle of Little Bighorn when he was just eighteen years old. Little Bighorn was a victory for the Sioux but shortly after the battle, Iron Tail followed Chief Sitting Bull into exile in Canada. They surrendered to US forces at Fort Buford in July of 1881, were pardoned, and allowed to settle on the Great Sioux Reservation of South Dakota with promises of peace and non-interference.Â  In February of 1890, the United States government dissolved the Great Sioux Reservation.</p> <p>In an effort to break tribal identity, individuals were forced to farm on 320 acre family plots and children were sent away to government schools that forbid any inclusion of traditional culture and language. This same period was marked by a severe drought that decimated crops and livestock.Â  In response, many of the desperate Sioux embraced a religious movement known as the Ghost Dance. The unity of the Ghost Dancers frightened the Bureau of Indian Affairs and military troops were dispatched to quell what US officials saw as a brewing Indian revolution. Tensions came to a head in December 1890 when Sitting Bull was killed during an arrest attempt on the Standing Rock reservation. A group of Ghost Dancers fled to join Chief Big Foot (Sitting Bull's half-brother) on the Cheyenne River Reservation where Iron Tail and his family were also living at that time. Big Foot tried to move to the Pine Ridge Agency where Chief Red Cloud could broker a negotiated surrender, but the Army surrounded the group at Wounded Knee Creek. Approximately 150 Lakota died in the fighting, another 150 died of exposure and 25 U.S. troops also perished. Iron Tail was severely wounded and lost his mother, father, two brothers, sister, and wife in the massacre, and his infant son who died a short time later.  </p>   <p>After Wounded Knee, Iron Tail settled near Kyle on the Pine Ridge Reservation.Â  Eventually he found employment with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/william-f-cody-buffalo-bill-double-signed-autograph-signatures-cabinet-card"">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>'s Wild West Show.Â  Cody had many ties to the Sioux tribe, especially at the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock Agencies. Chief Sitting Bull toured with the show in 1885.Â  During those performances he famously ""blessed"" audiences, cursing them in the Lakota language to clamorous applause. Sitting Bull returned to Standing Rock at the end of that season but Cody continued to hire Sioux performers almost exclusively, including such prominent figures as <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-autographed-hand-drawn-signed-self-portrait-sketch-1901-signature"">Geronimo</a> and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rain-in-the-face-signature-autograph-signed-1893-columbian-exposition-custer-little-big-horn"">Rain-in-the-Face</a>. Iron Tail traveled throughout Europe and the United States with the Wild West show for nearly 15 years as a marquee attraction and became a close friend of Cody, who often proclaimed that, <em>""Iron Tail is the finest man I have ever known, bar none.""</em></p> Many of the Native Americans who found employment in the various Wild West Shows eventually returned home and used the skills and insights they had gained to improve the still desperate situation on the reservations.Â  Iron Tail had some powerful friends in William Cody and General Nelson A. Miles, whom he had met during the Army investigations of the Wounded Knee massacre. With their support, he traveled to Washington, DC around the turn of the century to seek reparations for the victims. While in Washington he sat for sculptor James Earle Fraser as one of three models for the visage found on the Indian Head nickel that was released in 1913.  <p>Â <img alt=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" height=""204"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_6279706E-1517-6111-28537926D52D3747.jpg"" title=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" width=""410""/></p>   <p>On the same trip, Iron Tail also met the Battle of Manila Bay hero Admiral George Dewey. When the Chief later converted to Catholicism he adopted the name Dewey Beard in honor of the General.

""BUFFALO BILL""  CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and  showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of  Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the  American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with  cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody  got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply  Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the  nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a  soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third  Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs,  including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony  Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a  hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which  were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for  his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872  Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack  Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original  Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season,  Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok  to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's  part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where  he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge  for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody  put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of  entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded  ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word  ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that  toured annually.</p> <p>  In 1893 the title was  changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of  the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with  participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other  military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in  their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and  Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and  colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events,  feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western  personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a  band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well  known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband  Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of  Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the  riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and   stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed   General Custer.</p> <p><strong>GORDON WILLIAM LILLIE</strong> (1860-1942) became famous as the Wild  West showman and performer <em><strong>Pawnee Bill</strong></em>.</p>   <p>In 1888  Lillie and his wife, May, launched their own Wild West show: ""Pawnee  Bill's Historic Wild West"". May starred in the show as the ""Champion  Girl Horseback Shot of the West."" Their first season was a financial  disaster. They re-organized as a smaller operation called ""Pawnee Bill's  Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show."" The show was  popular but not lucrative. Gordon Lillie added Jose Barrera to the cast;  he was widely popular performing as ""Mexican Joe"". In 1907 Lillie hired  performers from a variety of backgrounds. The show included Mexican  cowboys, Pawnee Indians, Japanese performers, and Arab jugglers. The  ensemble debuted as ""Pawnee Bill's Great Far East Show."" In 1908 Pawnee  Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the ""Two Bills' Show"".  That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.  After the show closed, Lillie returned to his and May's ranch to live  full time.</p>   <p> <meta name=""Title""/> <meta name=""Keywords""/> <meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/> <meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Generator""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Originator""/> <link href=""file://localhost/Users/garymcavoy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <o:DocumentProperties>   <o:Template>Normal.dotm</o:Template>   <o:Revision>0</o:Revision>   <o:TotalTime>0</o:TotalTime>   <o:Pages>1</o:Pages>   <o:Words>149</o:Words>   <o:Characters>853</o:Characters>   <o:Company>GetToTheTop</o:Company>   <o:Lines>7</o:Lines>   <o:Paragraphs>1</o:Paragraphs>   <o:CharactersWithSpaces>1047</o:CharactersWithSpaces>   <o:Version>12.0</o:Version>  </o:DocumentProperties>  <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>   <o:AllowPNG/>  </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:WordDocument>   <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>   <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves>   <w:TrackFormatting/>   <w:PunctuationKerning/>   <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>   <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>   <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/>   <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>   <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent>   <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>   <w:Compatibility>    <w:BreakWrappedTables/>    <w:DontGrowAutofit/>    <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables/>    <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx/>   </w:Compatibility>  </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=""false"" LatentStyleCount=""276"">  </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <style> <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	panose-1:2 5 6 4 5 5 5 2 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:auto; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-parent:""""; 	margin:0in; 	margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-hansi-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} --> </style> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> <!--StartFragment--> </p> Â  <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

She was born in Globe, Arizona. Jacobs also served as a commander in the U.S. Navy intelligence during World War II, one of only five women to achieve that rank in the Navy.</p>   <p>Jacobs had a powerful serve and overhead smash and a sound backhand, but she never learned to hit a flat forehand, despite her friendship, and some coaching, from Bill Tilden.</p>   <p>Jacobs won five Grand Slam singles titles and was an eleven-time Grand Slam singles runner-up. Six of those losses were to Helen Wills Moody. Jacobs's only victory over Moody was in the final of the 1933 U.S. Championships. Moody retired from the match with a back injury while trailing 3-0 in the third set to a chorus of boos from the audience who believed that Moody quit the match merely to deny Jacobs the satisfaction of finishing out her victory. It was reported by many witnesses after the match that Moody still planned to play her doubles match later that afternoon but was advised against it because she was ""injured"" after all. Years later, Moody confirmed her injury, saying, ""My back is kind of funny. The vertebra between the fourth and fifth disk is thin. When the disk slips around it's intolerable. It rained the whole week before that final match. I lay in bed, and that was bad because it stiffened worse. I just couldn't play any longer, but I didn't say anything because it would look like an excuse."" Jacobs almost defeated Moody again when she had match point at 6-3, 3-6, 5-4 in the 1935 Wimbledon singles final but lost the match. In the 1938 Wimbledon final against Moody, Jacobs turned her ankle at 4-4 in the first set and hobbled around the court for the remainder of the match, with Moody winning the final eight games and the second set lasting a mere eight minutes. When asked after the match why she did not accept Hazel Wightman's on-court advice to quit the match after the injury, Jacobs said that continuing was the sporting thing to do so that Moody could enjoy the full taste of victory, an obvious allusion to Moody's retirement from the 1933 U.S. final. Moody said, ""I was very sorry about Helen's ankle. But it couldn't be helped, could it? I thought there was nothing I could do but get it over as quickly as possible."" In total, Jacobs lost 14 of the 15 career singles matches she played against Moody.</p>   <p>Jacobs won four Grand Slam women's doubles titles and one in mixed doubles. She was the runner-up at six Grand Slam women's doubles tournaments and one Grand Slam mixed doubles tournament. She won the singles and women's doubles titles at the Italian Championships in 1934.</p>   <p>According to Wallis Myers and John Olliff of <em>The Daily Telegraph</em> and the <em>Daily Mail</em>, Jacobs was ranked in the world top ten from 1928 through 1939 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of World No. 1 in those rankings in 1936. With the exceptions of 1930 and 1938, Jacobs was included in the year-end top ten rankings by the United States Tennis Association from 1927 through 1941. She was the top ranked U.S. player from 1932 through 1935.</p>   <p>Jacobs was a member of the U.S. Wightman Cup team from 1927 through 1937 and again in 1939. Her lifetime record was 19-11.</p> <p>In 1933, Jacobs became the first woman to break with tradition by wearing man-tailored shorts at Wimbledon.</p> <p>While she was still playing tennis, Jacobs became a writer. Her first books were <em>Modern Tennis</em> (1933) and <em>Improve Your Tennis</em> (1936). She also wrote fictional works, such as <em>Storm Against the Wind</em> (1944).

Still throbbing with natural emotions and desires, you would feel through the sense of touch the existence of a living world, and desperately but vainly you would seek an escape into its healing light.

In full:</p> <p style=""text-align: center""><em>With Mr. Longfellow's compliments and best wishes for the success of the Soldier's Fair.</em></p> <p>In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln called for the creation of the United States Sanitary Commission, organized to facilitate the delivery of goods to soldiers in the field during the Civil War. As the war progressed, the Sanitary Commission expanded its efforts, training nurses to staff hospitals, providing and staffing convalescent facilities for the wounded, and organizing a delivery system for troop mail. All this required a great deal of non-governmental funding. The Sanitary Commission was organized by civilians, run by civilians, and funded by civilians.</p> <p>Leaders of the Chicago branch of the Commission came up with the idea of a ""sanitary fair"" to benefit soldiers, which many patriotically dubbed the ""Soldier's Fair."" The ten-day Northwestern Soldier's Fair held in Chicago in 1863 raised over $100,000, followed soon after by the Boston Sanitary Fair in 1864, where $140,000 was raised.

""BUFFALO BILL""  CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and  showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of  Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the  American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with  cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody  got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply  Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the  nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a  soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third  Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs,  including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony  Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a  hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which  were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for  his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872  Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack  Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original  Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season,  Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok  to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's  part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where  he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge  for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody  put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of  entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded  ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word  ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that  toured annually.</p> <p>  In 1893 the title was  changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of  the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with  participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other  military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in  their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and  Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and  colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events,  feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western  personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a  band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well  known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband  Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of  Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the  riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and   stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed   General Custer.</p> <p><strong>GORDON WILLIAM LILLIE</strong> (1860-1942) became famous as the Wild  West showman and performer <em><strong>Pawnee Bill</strong></em>.</p>   <p>In 1888  Lillie and his wife, May, launched their own Wild West show: ""Pawnee  Bill's Historic Wild West"". May starred in the show as the ""Champion  Girl Horseback Shot of the West."" Their first season was a financial  disaster. They re-organized as a smaller operation called ""Pawnee Bill's  Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show."" The show was  popular but not lucrative. Gordon Lillie added Jose Barrera to the cast;  he was widely popular performing as ""Mexican Joe"". In 1907 Lillie hired  performers from a variety of backgrounds. The show included Mexican  cowboys, Pawnee Indians, Japanese performers, and Arab jugglers. The  ensemble debuted as ""Pawnee Bill's Great Far East Show."" In 1908 Pawnee  Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the ""Two Bills' Show"".  That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.  After the show closed, Lillie returned to his and May's ranch to live  full time.</p>   <p> <meta name=""Title""/> <meta name=""Keywords""/> <meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/> <meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Generator""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Originator""/> <link href=""file://localhost/Users/garymcavoy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <o:DocumentProperties>   <o:Template>Normal.dotm</o:Template>   <o:Revision>0</o:Revision>   <o:TotalTime>0</o:TotalTime>   <o:Pages>1</o:Pages>   <o:Words>149</o:Words>   <o:Characters>853</o:Characters>   <o:Company>GetToTheTop</o:Company>   <o:Lines>7</o:Lines>   <o:Paragraphs>1</o:Paragraphs>   <o:CharactersWithSpaces>1047</o:CharactersWithSpaces>   <o:Version>12.0</o:Version>  </o:DocumentProperties>  <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>   <o:AllowPNG/>  </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:WordDocument>   <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>   <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves>   <w:TrackFormatting/>   <w:PunctuationKerning/>   <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>   <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>   <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/>   <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>   <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent>   <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>   <w:Compatibility>    <w:BreakWrappedTables/>    <w:DontGrowAutofit/>    <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables/>    <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx/>   </w:Compatibility>  </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=""false"" LatentStyleCount=""276"">  </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <style> <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	panose-1:2 5 6 4 5 5 5 2 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:auto; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-parent:""""; 	margin:0in; 	margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-hansi-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} --> </style> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> <!--StartFragment--> </p> Â  <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

It is believed that all medals were destroyed after her death. Unsigned in fine condition, 3"" x 4"" mounted to light brown card with various markings from Culver Pictures on reverse. </p> <p><strong>Annie Oakley</strong> (1860-1926), born Phoebe Ann Mosey, was an American sharpshooter and exhibition shooter. Oakley's amazing talent and timely rise to fame led to a starring role in Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, which propelled her to become the first American female superstar.</p> <p>Using a .22 caliber rifle at 90 feet (27 m), Oakley reputedly could split a playing card edge-on and put five or six more holes in it before it touched the ground. Annie began hunting at age nine to support her siblings and her widowed mother. She sold the hunting game for money to locals in Greenville, as well as restaurants and hotels in southern Ohio. Her skill eventually paid off the mortgage on her mother's farm when Annie was 15. </p> <p>Oakley soon became well known throughout the region. During the spring of 1881, the Baughman and Butler shooting act was being performed in Cincinnati. Traveling show marksman and former dog trainer Francis E. Butler, an Irish immigrant, placed a $100 bet per side (roughly equivalent to $2,000 in today's money) with Cincinnati hotel owner Jack Frost, that Butler, age 31, could beat any local fancy shooter. The hotelier arranged a shooting match with Oakley, age 21, to be held in ten days in a small town near Greenville, Ohio. After missing his 25th shot, Butler lost the match and the bet, but he began courting Oakley, and they married on June 20, 1882.</p> <p>Oakley continued to set records into her 60s, and she also engaged in extensive, albeit quiet, philanthropy for women's rights and other causes, including the support of specific young women that she knew. She embarked on a comeback and intended to star in a feature-length silent movie. In a 1922 shooting contest in Pinehurst, North Carolina, sixty-two-year-old Oakley hit 100 clay targets from 16 yards (15 m).</p> <p>Her health declined in 1925 and she died of pernicious anemia in Greenville, Ohio at the age of sixty-six in 1926. </p>  ",c1882,sold,1,FALSE,3544,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9C713131-1517-6111-28C972D6D3971B5A.png,William F.

A classic image of  Cody dressed in a fringed and beaded buckskin jacket with his long  curly hair flowing from beneath his hat. The verso is facsimile ink-stamped ""Yours  truly, W. F. Cody"".</strong><strong></strong></p> <p><strong>WILLIAM  FREDERICK ""BUFFALO BILL"" CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).  </p> <strong></strong> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs, including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872 Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season, Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that toured annually.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In 1893 the title was changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events, feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and  stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic  re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed  General Custer.</p>  ",c1880s,sold,1,FALSE,3452,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/52AF4B50-3048-C0CE-55427B56937B915F.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/73CCE217-1517-6111-28AEAC67D8664117.jpg",

In the film's dramatic climax, Oldfield races a train to save heroine Mable Normand, who has been tied to the tracks by the black-hatted villain played by Ford Sterling.</p> <p>Much to the chagrin of racing's elite, however, Oldfield's ""outlaw"" reputation only added to his fame and popularity with the public.

Small tear lower right that does not extend into drawing or signature.  Minor surface stains, some of which appear to be water staining.  <br/><br/>A nearly identical version of this signed drawing was sold in June 2008 by <a href=""http://www.cowanauctions.com/past_sales_view_item.asp?ItemId=61379"" target=""_blank"">Cowan's Auction House</a>, well-known experts in fine American Indian and Western art, where owner Wes Cowan (who is also an appraiser on PBS's <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>) estimated its value upwards of $20,000.  As can be seen at the link, while Cowan's item was in better condition,  this appears to be only the second such Geronimo drawing known to come  to market in recent history, making it an exceptionally rare artifact  from the highly regarded Native American warrior. </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>Geronimo</strong> (1829-1909) was a Chiricahua  military leader who was believed by his followers to have some spiritual  ""powers,"" such as the ability to walk without leaving tracks and to  survive gunshots. He led raids on both sides of the Southwestern border,  eluding capture by both the Mexican and U.S. Armies for nearly three  decades. He is often considered the last ""hold out,"" refusing to  recognize American occupation of the region, and leading an independent  band of native people. <br/><br/>Geronimo was finally captured in 1886 by a  troop of the 4th Cavalry led by Captain Henry Lawton under General  Nelson Miles. Geronimo himself gave credit to 1st. Lieut. Charles  Gatewood, whom he knew and who spoke some Apache, as being the person  who convinced him to surrender, but Lawton gave credit to a number of  his men, and, of course, many others claimed the feat over the years.  Geronimo would spend the remainder of his life as a prisoner of war.  After he was moved to Fort Sill, OK in 1894, Geronimo was given some  freedom. </p> <p>He quickly understood commercialism and he became his own best PR man as he realized the value of all things connected with him. His appearances generated much interest at the Omaha Exposition of 1898, the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, the <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">St. Louis World's Fair in 1904</a>, Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration parade in 1905, numerous Wild West shows, and other public events. Promoters of these events had to appeal to the War Department to obtain permission for his appearance. At many of the events Geronimo would sell his autograph, photographs of himself as well as bows and arrows. In his autobiography, Geronimo talks about his experience at the St. Louis World's fair, ""I often made as much as two dollars a day, and when I returned I had plenty of money Â­ more than I had ever owned before. I am glad I went to the Fair."" </p> <p>At some point in his captivity, Geronimo  learned to read a bit and  write his name, and later even embraced  Christianity. His writing  always had a child-like quality, and he  preferred pencil to pen. He  seemed to like to embellish his signature,  sometimes putting designs in  the ""G,"" often filling in the ""O's,"" as in  this signature. Sometimes  all letters were serifed, sometimes only a few  were. </p> <p>Contrary to this supposed life of leisure Geronimo and the Apache people suffered both physically and mentally. During their stay in Florida and Alabama many Apaches died of tuberculosis and other diseases. Throughout the time spent as a prisoner of war, Geronimo never stopped asking to be allowed to return to his homeland in the Southwest. He died a prisoner of war at Fort Sills. </p> <p><img alt=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2ED01AA5-1517-6111-28A69F54C084AEB7.png"" title=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" width=""244""/><br/><em>Geronimo in the Indian Village at the 1901<br/>Pan American Exposition, Buffalo, New York.<br/>Image from the Library of Congress.</em></p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

This autograph was obtained in person while Rain-in-the-Face was a participant in one of several ""cultural villages"" featured in the Exposition reflecting peoples from around the world.<br/></strong></p>   <p>The World's Columbian Exposition (also called The Chicago World's Fair), was held in Chicago in 1893, to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the New World. The fair had a profound and lasting effect on architecture, the arts, Chicago's self-image, and American industrial optimism. The Exposition covered more than 600 acres, featuring nearly 200 new buildings of classical architecture, canals and lagoons, and people and cultures from around the world. Over 27 million people (equivalent to about half the U.S. population at the time) attended the Exposition during its six-month run. Its scale and grandeur far exceeded the other world fairs, and it became a symbol of then-emerging American Exceptionalism.</p>   <p><strong>This remarkable historical artifact has been affixed onto a page of a large format (10"" x 12"") souvenir book of the 1893 World's Fair, presented entirely in the German language, featuring detailed descriptions of the buildings, architecture, and exhibitions displayed throughout the Exposition. The particular page shown in the photos here, to which the ticket has been affixed, features ""Sitting Bull's Cabin""âthe actual cabin the great Sioux chief died in. During the Exposition, according to the book ""Dedicatory and opening ceremonies of the World's Columbian exposition: historical and descriptive (Memorial Volume),"": <em>""...Sitting Bull's Cabin was filled with a number of Indians, including Rain-in-the-Face. War dances were given daily."" </em></strong>In the photo to the left, Rain-in-the-Face is the Indian figure standing without a hat, next to the fence. The entire souvenir book, approximately an inch thick, is included in this offering, providing further rock-solid provenance from the period itself.</p>   <p><strong>Also affixed to the page is a curious period newspaper article describing a knife wound Rain-in-the-Face suffered at the hands of a vengeful Sioux squaw, noting the chief was near death at the time. </strong>The Admission Ticket was personally signed by Chief Rain-in-the-Face for Swiss businessman M. Grimmer, whose nephew noted enthusiastically on the page next to the autograph: <em>""Signature of Chief 'Rain in the Face'. He killed Gen. Custer at Little Big Horn. My uncle met this Indian personally at the 1893 World Fair!""</em> A signed letter of provenance accompanies this outstanding item, furnished by the agent who acquired the memorabilia directly from the Grimmer family in Switzerland. We also obtained a beautiful, authentic <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">Geronimo</a> autograph from this same source, which recently sold at auction. </p>   <p>This is a truly historic, one-of-a-kind memento from one of the most feared and respected Native American warriors of the late 19th century, of which few authentic exemplars have survived. Rain-in-the-Face is among the rarest of Americana signatures, far more difficult to find than Geronimo or Sitting Bull. We know of only two other offerings that have been on the market in many years. A signed letter of provenance accompanies this outstanding item, furnished by the agent who acquired the memorabilia directly from the Grimmer family in Switzerland.</p> <p><strong>RAIN-IN-THE-FACE</strong> (also known as Ito-na-gaju or Exa-ma-gozua) (1835-1905) was a war chief of the Lakota Sioux tribe of Native Americans. He was among the Indian leaders who defeated General George Armstrong Custer and the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment at the 1876 Battle of Little Big Horn.</p> <p>Born in the Dakota Territory near the forks of the Cheyenne River about 1835, Rain-in-the-Face was from the Hunkpapa band within the Lakota nation. He first fought against the whites in the summer of 1866 when he participated in a raid against Fort Totten in what is now North Dakota. In 1868, he again fought the U.S. Army in the Fetterman massacre near Fort Phil Kearny in present-day Montana. He again was on the warpath during the Black Hills War, leading a raid near the Tongue River in which two white civilians accompanying Custer's cavalry were killed. He returned to the Standing Rock Reservation, but was captured by Custer after being betrayed by reservation Indians. He was taken to Fort Abraham Lincoln and incarcerated. However, he was freed by a sympathetic soldier and returned to the reservation, then fled to the Powder River. In the spring of 1876, he joined Sitting Bull and traveled with him to the Little Big Horn River in early June.</p>   <p>During the subsequent fighting on Custer Hill on June 25, Rain-in-the-Face is alleged to have cut the heart out of Thomas Custer, a feat that was popularized by American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow in <em>The Revenge of Rain in the Face</em>. According to legend, Tom Custer had unjustly imprisoned Rain-in-the-Face. Some contemporary accounts also claimed that the war chief had personally dispatched George Custer as well, but in the confused fighting, a number of similar claims have been attributed to other warriors.

Rain-in-the-Face,Rain-in-the-Face,,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904/,Signed Hand-Drawn Sketch,"  <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>Geronimo signed and hand-drawn sketch of a figure believed to represent a <em>gaan</em>  dancer, with headdress, feathers dangling from his upper arms, and a  wand in each hand. The figure even has ""cactus kickers"" on his  moccasins.</strong> This 3.75"" x 6"" drawing is backed with watermarked paper such as is commonly used for book endpapers. Small tear lower right that does not extend into drawing or signature.  Minor surface stains, some of which appear to be water staining.  <br/><br/>A nearly identical version of this signed drawing was sold in June 2008 by <a href=""http://www.cowanauctions.com/past_sales_view_item.asp?ItemId=61379"" target=""_blank"">Cowan's Auction House</a>, well-known experts in fine American Indian and Western art, where owner Wes Cowan (who is also an appraiser on PBS's <em>Antiques Roadshow</em>) estimated its value upwards of $20,000.  As can be seen at the link, while Cowan's item was in better condition,  this appears to be only the second such Geronimo drawing known to come  to market in recent history, making it an exceptionally rare artifact  from the highly regarded Native American warrior. </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>Geronimo</strong> (1829-1909) was a Chiricahua  military leader who was believed by his followers to have some spiritual  ""powers,"" such as the ability to walk without leaving tracks and to  survive gunshots. He led raids on both sides of the Southwestern border,  eluding capture by both the Mexican and U.S. Armies for nearly three  decades. He is often considered the last ""hold out,"" refusing to  recognize American occupation of the region, and leading an independent  band of native people. <br/><br/>Geronimo was finally captured in 1886 by a  troop of the 4th Cavalry led by Captain Henry Lawton under General  Nelson Miles. Geronimo himself gave credit to 1st. Lieut. Charles  Gatewood, whom he knew and who spoke some Apache, as being the person  who convinced him to surrender, but Lawton gave credit to a number of  his men, and, of course, many others claimed the feat over the years.  Geronimo would spend the remainder of his life as a prisoner of war.  After he was moved to Fort Sill, OK in 1894, Geronimo was given some  freedom. </p> <p>He quickly understood commercialism and he became his own best PR man as he realized the value of all things connected with him. His appearances generated much interest at the Omaha Exposition of 1898, the Pan American Exposition at Buffalo in 1901, the <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">St. Louis World's Fair in 1904</a>, Theodore Roosevelt's inauguration parade in 1905, numerous Wild West shows, and other public events. Promoters of these events had to appeal to the War Department to obtain permission for his appearance. At many of the events Geronimo would sell his autograph, photographs of himself as well as bows and arrows. In his autobiography, Geronimo talks about his experience at the St. Louis World's fair, ""I often made as much as two dollars a day, and when I returned I had plenty of money Â­ more than I had ever owned before. I am glad I went to the Fair."" </p> <p>At some point in his captivity, Geronimo  learned to read a bit and  write his name, and later even embraced  Christianity. His writing  always had a child-like quality, and he  preferred pencil to pen. He  seemed to like to embellish his signature,  sometimes putting designs in  the ""G,"" often filling in the ""O's,"" as in  this signature. Sometimes  all letters were serifed, sometimes only a few  were. </p> <p>Contrary to this supposed life of leisure Geronimo and the Apache people suffered both physically and mentally. During their stay in Florida and Alabama many Apaches died of tuberculosis and other diseases. Throughout the time spent as a prisoner of war, Geronimo never stopped asking to be allowed to return to his homeland in the Southwest. He died a prisoner of war at Fort Sills. </p> <p><img alt=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2ED01AA5-1517-6111-28A69F54C084AEB7.png"" title=""Geronimo at 1901 Pan American Exposition"" width=""244""/><br/><em>Geronimo in the Indian Village at the 1901<br/>Pan American Exposition, Buffalo, New York.<br/>Image from the Library of Congress.</em></p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Though he learned and spoke English fairly well, anything written or signed by Iron Tail is exceedingly scarce and rarely comes to market. Accompanied by an actual vintage photograph </strong><strong>showing Iron Tail in a tribal dance </strong><strong>(approx 2 inches square) taken by the original Swiss collector who obtained the signed drawing </strong><strong>personally at Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show circa 1900; plus two</strong><strong> vintage postcards of Iron Tail in regalia, and of his squaws with papooses at the Wild West Show. Provenance included in original album containing other unknown autographs gathered by this </strong><strong>European collector, from whose estate we have acquired many historic and authentically signed items.</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>IRON TAIL</strong> (1857-1955) (aka <em>Sinte Maza</em> and <em>Wasu Maza</em>, among other variations) was an Oglala Sioux (Lakota). He fought under Crazy Horse in 1876 at the Battle of Little Bighorn when he was just eighteen years old. Little Bighorn was a victory for the Sioux but shortly after the battle, Iron Tail followed Chief Sitting Bull into exile in Canada. They surrendered to US forces at Fort Buford in July of 1881, were pardoned, and allowed to settle on the Great Sioux Reservation of South Dakota with promises of peace and non-interference.Â  In February of 1890, the United States government dissolved the Great Sioux Reservation.</p> <p>In an effort to break tribal identity, individuals were forced to farm on 320 acre family plots and children were sent away to government schools that forbid any inclusion of traditional culture and language. This same period was marked by a severe drought that decimated crops and livestock.Â  In response, many of the desperate Sioux embraced a religious movement known as the Ghost Dance. The unity of the Ghost Dancers frightened the Bureau of Indian Affairs and military troops were dispatched to quell what US officials saw as a brewing Indian revolution. Tensions came to a head in December 1890 when Sitting Bull was killed during an arrest attempt on the Standing Rock reservation. A group of Ghost Dancers fled to join Chief Big Foot (Sitting Bull's half-brother) on the Cheyenne River Reservation where Iron Tail and his family were also living at that time. Big Foot tried to move to the Pine Ridge Agency where Chief Red Cloud could broker a negotiated surrender, but the Army surrounded the group at Wounded Knee Creek. Approximately 150 Lakota died in the fighting, another 150 died of exposure and 25 U.S. troops also perished. Iron Tail was severely wounded and lost his mother, father, two brothers, sister, and wife in the massacre, and his infant son who died a short time later.  </p>   <p>After Wounded Knee, Iron Tail settled near Kyle on the Pine Ridge Reservation.Â  Eventually he found employment with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/william-f-cody-buffalo-bill-double-signed-autograph-signatures-cabinet-card"">Buffalo Bill Cody</a>'s Wild West Show.Â  Cody had many ties to the Sioux tribe, especially at the Pine Ridge and Standing Rock Agencies. Chief Sitting Bull toured with the show in 1885.Â  During those performances he famously ""blessed"" audiences, cursing them in the Lakota language to clamorous applause. Sitting Bull returned to Standing Rock at the end of that season but Cody continued to hire Sioux performers almost exclusively, including such prominent figures as <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-autographed-hand-drawn-signed-self-portrait-sketch-1901-signature"">Geronimo</a> and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rain-in-the-face-signature-autograph-signed-1893-columbian-exposition-custer-little-big-horn"">Rain-in-the-Face</a>. Iron Tail traveled throughout Europe and the United States with the Wild West show for nearly 15 years as a marquee attraction and became a close friend of Cody, who often proclaimed that, <em>""Iron Tail is the finest man I have ever known, bar none.""</em></p> Many of the Native Americans who found employment in the various Wild West Shows eventually returned home and used the skills and insights they had gained to improve the still desperate situation on the reservations.Â  Iron Tail had some powerful friends in William Cody and General Nelson A. Miles, whom he had met during the Army investigations of the Wounded Knee massacre. With their support, he traveled to Washington, DC around the turn of the century to seek reparations for the victims. While in Washington he sat for sculptor James Earle Fraser as one of three models for the visage found on the Indian Head nickel that was released in 1913.  <p>Â <img alt=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" height=""204"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_6279706E-1517-6111-28537926D52D3747.jpg"" title=""Indian Head Buffalo Nickel 1913"" width=""410""/></p>   <p>On the same trip, Iron Tail also met the Battle of Manila Bay hero Admiral George Dewey. When the Chief later converted to Catholicism he adopted the name Dewey Beard in honor of the General. Iron Tail, now Dewey Beard, remarried and had a son, became a rancher and raised horses, but still he remained a showman. He had parts in some ""westerns"" including Cody's silent film about Wounded Knee. Up until the last years of his life, he performed at regional powwows and tourist venues and used his visibility to speak out against the mistreatment of Native Americans. </p> <p>The following exemplar of a strikingly similar original signed drawing by Iron Tail appears in the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Buffalo-Bills-Wild-West-Warriors/dp/0061129771/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1266882496&amp;sr=8-1"" target=""_blank""><strong><em>Buffalo Bill's Wild West Warriors: A Photographic History by Gertrude KÃ¤sebier</em></strong></a> by Michelle Delaney, Â© 2007 Smithsonian Institution (Collins, New York: 2007):</p> <p><img alt=""Iron Tail Drawing Exemplar"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_F80DCCF2-1517-6111-2873D9177EB86780.jpg"" title=""Iron Tail Drawing Exemplar"" width=""273""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

""BUFFALO BILL""  CODY</strong> (1846-1917) was an American  soldier, bison hunter and  showman. He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of  Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the  American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with  cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody  got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply  Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the  nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a  soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third  Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs,  including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony  Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a  hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which  were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for  his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872  Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack  Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original  Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season,  Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok  to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's  part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where  he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge  for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody  put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of  entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded  ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word  ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that  toured annually.</p> <p>  In 1893 the title was  changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of  the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with  participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other  military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in  their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and  Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and  colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events,  feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western  personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a  band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well  known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband  Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of  Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the  riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and   stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed   General Custer.</p> <p><strong>GORDON WILLIAM LILLIE</strong> (1860-1942) became famous as the Wild  West showman and performer <em><strong>Pawnee Bill</strong></em>.</p>   <p>In 1888  Lillie and his wife, May, launched their own Wild West show: ""Pawnee  Bill's Historic Wild West"". May starred in the show as the ""Champion  Girl Horseback Shot of the West."" Their first season was a financial  disaster. They re-organized as a smaller operation called ""Pawnee Bill's  Historical Wild West Indian Museum and Encampment Show."" The show was  popular but not lucrative. Gordon Lillie added Jose Barrera to the cast;  he was widely popular performing as ""Mexican Joe"". In 1907 Lillie hired  performers from a variety of backgrounds. The show included Mexican  cowboys, Pawnee Indians, Japanese performers, and Arab jugglers. The  ensemble debuted as ""Pawnee Bill's Great Far East Show."" In 1908 Pawnee  Bill and Buffalo Bill joined forces and created the ""Two Bills' Show"".  That show was foreclosed on when it was playing in Denver, Colorado.  After the show closed, Lillie returned to his and May's ranch to live  full time.</p>   <p> <meta name=""Title""/> <meta name=""Keywords""/> <meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/> <meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Generator""/> <meta content=""Microsoft Word 2008"" name=""Originator""/> <link href=""file://localhost/Users/garymcavoy/Library/Caches/TemporaryItems/msoclip/0clip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/> <!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <o:DocumentProperties>   <o:Template>Normal.dotm</o:Template>   <o:Revision>0</o:Revision>   <o:TotalTime>0</o:TotalTime>   <o:Pages>1</o:Pages>   <o:Words>149</o:Words>   <o:Characters>853</o:Characters>   <o:Company>GetToTheTop</o:Company>   <o:Lines>7</o:Lines>   <o:Paragraphs>1</o:Paragraphs>   <o:CharactersWithSpaces>1047</o:CharactersWithSpaces>   <o:Version>12.0</o:Version>  </o:DocumentProperties>  <o:OfficeDocumentSettings>   <o:AllowPNG/>  </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:WordDocument>   <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom>   <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves>   <w:TrackFormatting/>   <w:PunctuationKerning/>   <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>   <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>   <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>   <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas/>   <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>   <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent>   <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>   <w:Compatibility>    <w:BreakWrappedTables/>    <w:DontGrowAutofit/>    <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables/>    <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx/>   </w:Compatibility>  </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>  <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=""false"" LatentStyleCount=""276"">  </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <style> <!--  /* Font Definitions */ @font-face 	{font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	panose-1:2 5 6 4 5 5 5 2 2 4; 	mso-font-charset:0; 	mso-generic-font-family:auto; 	mso-font-pitch:variable; 	mso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}  /* Style Definitions */ p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal 	{mso-style-parent:""""; 	margin:0in; 	margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-hansi-font-family:""Bookman Old Style""; 	mso-bidi-font-family:""Times New Roman"";} @page Section1 	{size:8.5in 11.0in; 	margin:1.0in 1.25in 1.0in 1.25in; 	mso-header-margin:.5in; 	mso-footer-margin:.5in; 	mso-paper-source:0;} div.Section1 	{page:Section1;} --> </style> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:12.0pt; 	font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> <!--StartFragment--> </p> Â  <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He was born in the Iowa Territory  (now the American state of Iowa), near Le Claire. He was one of the most  colorful figures of the American Old West, and mostly famous for the  shows he organized with cowboy themes. Buffalo Bill received the Medal  of Honor in 1872. Cody got his nickname ""Buffalo Bill"" after he  undertook a contract to supply Kansas Pacific Railroad workers with  buffalo meat. Cody earned the nickname by killing 4,280 buffalo in  eighteen months (1867-68).  </p> <strong></strong> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In addition  to his documented service as a soldier during the Civil War and as Chief  of Scouts for the Third Cavalry during the Plains Wars, Cody claimed to  have worked many jobs, including as a trapper, bullwhacker,  ""Fifty-Niner"" in Colorado, a Pony Express rider in 1860, wagon master,  stagecoach driver, and even a hotel manager, but it's unclear which  claims were factual and which were fabricated for purposes of publicity.  He became world famous for his Wild West show.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In December 1872 Cody traveled to Chicago to  make his stage debut with friend Texas Jack Omohundro in <em>The Scouts  of the Prairie</em>, one of the original Wild West shows produced by Ned  Buntline. During the 1873-74 season, Cody and Omohundro invited their  friend James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok to join them in a new play called  <em>Scouts of the Plains</em>.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">The  troupe toured for ten years and Cody's part typically included an 1876  incident at the Warbonnet Creek where he claimed to have scalped a  Cheyenne warrior, purportedly in revenge for the death of George  Armstrong Custer. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">It was the age of  great showmen and traveling entertainers. Cody put together a new  traveling show based on both of those forms of entertainment. In 1883 in  the area of North Platte, Nebraska he founded ""Buffalo Bill's Wild  West,"" (despite popular misconception, the word ""show"" was not a part of  the title) a circus-like attraction that toured annually.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">In 1893 the title was changed to ""Buffalo Bill's  Wild West and Congress of Rough Riders of the World"". The show began  with a parade on horseback, with participants from horse-culture groups  that included US and other military, American Indians, and performers  from all over the world in their best attire. There were Turks, Gauchos,  Arabs, Mongols and Cossacks, among others, each showing their own  distinctive horses and colorful costumes. Visitors to this spectacle  could see main events, feats of skill, staged races, and sideshows. Many  authentic western personalities were part of the show. For example  Sitting Bull and a band of twenty braves appeared. Cody's headline  performers were well known in their own right. People like Annie Oakley  and her husband Frank Butler put on shooting exhibitions along with the  likes of Gabriel Dumont. Buffalo Bill and his performers would re-enact  the riding of the Pony Express, Indian attacks on wagon trains, and  stagecoach robberies. The show typically ended with a melodramatic  re-enactment of Custer's Last Stand in which Cody himself portrayed  General Custer.</p>  ",c1880s,sold,1,FALSE,3452,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/52AF4B50-3048-C0CE-55427B56937B915F.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/73CCE217-1517-6111-28AEAC67D8664117.jpg",

As news of peace trickled in, Nichols decided to call in some ling-time debts owed to him by some of Smith's neighbors in western Pennsylvania.

Smith was then chosen to be a delegate to the Continental Congress from 1781 to 1782.

Also comes with PSA/DNA COA.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>JACK ROOSEVELT</strong><strong> ""JACKIE"" ROBINSON</strong> (1919-1972) was the first African-American Major League Baseball player of the modern era. Although not the first African-American professional baseball player in United States history, Robinson's 1947 Major League debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers ended approximately 60 years of baseball segregation, breaking the baseball color line, or color barrier. At that time in the United States, many white people believed that blacks and whites should be kept apart in many aspects of life, including sports. Despite this obstacle, Robinson went on to have an exceptional baseball career.</p>   <p>Robinson played on six World Series teams and was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962. He earned six consecutive All-Star Game nominations and won several awards during his career. In 1947, Jackie won The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award and the first MLB Rookie of the Year Award. Two years later, he won the National League MVP Award-the first black player to do so. On April 15, 1997, the 50-year anniversary of his debut, Major League Baseball retired Robinson's jersey number 42 across all MLB teams in recognition of his accomplishments in a ceremony at Shea Stadium.</p>   <p>He also had success away from the baseball field. Robinson was the first African-American Major League Baseball analyst and the first black vice president of a major American corporation. In the 1960s, he helped to establish the Freedom National Bank, an African-American owned and controlled entity based in Harlem, New York. Due to his achievements, Robinson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. In 1950, he played himself in the biographical film The Jackie Robinson Story. In 1946, Robinson married Rachel Annetta Isum, and after Robinson died of a heart attack in 1972, she founded the Jackie Robinson Foundation.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

One page, both sides, dated May 23, 1965, just four months before Schweitzer's death. With stamped and postmarked envelope. </strong></p> <p>In addition to dedicating his life's work as a medical missionary in Africa, Dr. Schweitzer was a respected music scholar and organist. He studied the music of German composer Johann Sebastian Bach and influenced the Organ reform movement. In 1893 he played for the French organist Charles-Marie Widor (at Saint-Sulpice, Paris), for whom Johann Sebastian Bach's organ-music contained a mystic sense of the eternal. Widor, deeply impressed, agreed to teach Schweitzer without fee, and a great and influential friendship was begun.  </p>   <p>Dr. Schweitzer's nurse and secretary wrote a prelude to the letter. Following that is Schweitzer's portion, translated approximately from German, in full:</p>   <blockquote><p><em><strong>I thank you for your nice lines you have written about me. In the paper, in which you wrote about me, I found the picture of the Cathedral of Uppsala, where I have been so often. Here in Lambarene everything is going well.

In the hospital are 520 beds for sick people.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>With the best of thoughts,<br/>Albert Schweitzer</strong></em></p></blockquote>   <p>The Cathedral of Uppsala in Sweden is a historic church with one of the largest organs in Sweden, built in 1692-98 by Hans Henrich Cahman, regarded as the father of Swedish organ building.</p>   <p><strong>ALBERT SCHWEITZER</strong> (1875-1965) was an Alsatian German-French theologian, musician, philosopher, and physician. He was born in Kaysersberg in the province of Alsace-Lorraine, from 1871 to 1918 in the German Empire. Schweitzer challenged both the secular view of Jesus as depicted by historical-critical methodology current at his time in certain academic circles, as well as the traditional Christian view, depicting a Jesus Christ who expected and predicted the imminent end of the world. He received the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize for his philosophy of ""Reverence for Life"", expressed in many ways, but most famously in founding and sustaining the Albert Schweitzer Hospital in LambarÃ©nÃ©, now in Gabon, west central Africa.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Mark Twain, Mark,Twain,U.S. History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/mark-twain-the-prince-and-the-pauper-signed/,The Prince & the Pauper SIGNED,"  <p><strong>Exceedingly rare signed copy of the 1892 illustrated edition of Mark Twain's <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em>. Originally published in Canada in 1881 (1882 in the US), <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> was Twain's first book following <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em> (1876).</strong> It was his first attempt at historical fiction, and ranks among his earliest and most endearing social satires.</p> <p>When Samuel Clemens started his own publishing house in May 1884, he hired his nephew Charles Webster to manage it and the company took Webster's name as publisher. James R. Osgood, Clemens's former publisher, declared bankruptcy in 1885, handing Twain the opportunity to acquire rights to all of his titles that were published by Osgood, which could then be published under Twain's own Webster imprint. Webster then reissued this and other editions of <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em>, along with other books by Twain as well as many other notable authors of the day.</p> <p>These Webster editions were bound in matching light tan bindings to appeal to buyers on a more limited budget who also wanted uniformity. In tightly-woven golden/brown cloth-covered boards with bright illustrations on cover, bright gilt lettering on a firm spine with a black emblem of three plumes; interior is intact and tight, with only slight lower edge damage to a couple front endpapers, and very mild toning on the title page, not affecting the signature. With 60 black and white illustrations throughout penned by Frank Thayer Merrill, whose work pleased Clemens in the original 1881 edition.</p> <p>12mo (duodecimo), 8"" x 6"" 289 pages plus nine advertisements at the back. Very Good ++ condition, without dust jacket as issued. SIGNED ""Mark Twain"" on the title page. Additional photos provided on request.</p> <p>Set in 16th-century England, <em>The Prince and the Pauper</em> is the story of two uncannily identical but discontented boys ""temporarily"" exchanging roles in life, and the consequences they encounter in doing so. Edward, the young Prince of Wales, yearns for freedom and adventure, a ""normal"" life away from the strict formalities of the royal court. With the help of Tom Canty, a beggar's son, he realizes his dream is not at all what he had expected.</p> <p>As Edward experiences the brutish life of a pauper firsthand, he becomes aware of the stark class inequality in England. In particular, he sees the harsh, punitive nature of the English judicial system where people are burned at the stake, pilloried, and flogged. Tom, posing as the prince, tries to cope with court customs and manners. His fellow nobles and palace staff think ""the prince"" has an illness which has caused memory loss and fear he will go mad. They repeatedly ask him about the missing ""Great Seal,"" but he knows nothing about it; however, when Tom is asked to sit in on judgments, his common-sense observations reassure them his mind is sound.</p> <p>As is typical with Mark Twain's books, morals abound: how perception often determines our reality; that walking in the shoes of another isn't always what it's made out to be; that the abuse of power has severe consequences. </p> <p>A very rare signed copy in spectacular shape, especially for being over 120 years old.</p>  ",1892,sold,1,FALSE,3709,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/16457DAA-1517-6111-2883E1F974F741D9.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1646600B-1517-6111-284E8175CCC65204.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1647428C-1517-6111-2877A3D319FA65D2.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1646CD8A-1517-6111-2803FD9388A1E2C5.jpg",Samuel Clemens

He felt at home with the Savages, and put on his trademark white suit for the only time publicly in England. He wrote for them one of his reminiscent speeches, recalling his association with them on his first visit to London, thirty-seven years before. The speech, containing many of Twain's wittiest observations on literature and camaraderie, reads in full:</p> <blockquote><p>MR. CHAIRMAN AND FELLOW-SAVAGES,<br/>I am very glad indeed to have that portrait. I think it is the best one that I have ever had, and there have been opportunities before to get a good photograph. I have sat to photographers twenty-two times to-day. Those sittings added to those that have preceded them since I have been in Europeâif we average at that rateâmust have numbered one hundred to two hundred sittings. Out of all those there ought to be some good photographs. This is the best I have had, and I am glad to have your honored names on it. I did not know Harold Frederic personally, but I have heard a great deal about him, and nothing that was not pleasant and nothing except such things as lead a man to honor another man and to love him. I consider that it is a misfortune of mine that I have never had the luck to meet him, and if any book of mine read to him in his last hours made those hours easier for him and more comfortable, I am very glad and proud of that. I call to mind such a case many years ago of an English authoress, well known in her day, who wrote such beautiful child tales, touching and lovely in every possible way. In a little biographical sketch of her I found that her last hours were spent partly in reading a book of mine, until she was no longer able to read. That has always remained in my mind, and I have always cherished it as one of the good things of my life. I had read what she had written, and had loved her for what she had done.  Stanley apparently carried a book of mine feloniously away to Africa, and I have not a doubt that it had a noble and uplifting influence there in the wilds of Africaâbecause on his previous journeys he never carried anything to read except Shakespeare and the Bible. I did not know of that circumstance. I did not know that he had carried a book of mine. I only noticed that when he came back he was a reformed man. I knew Stanley very well in those old days. </p><p>Stanley was the first man who ever reported a lecture of mine, and that was in St. Louis. When I was down there the next time to give the same lecture I was told to give them something fresh, as they had read that in the papers. I met Stanley here when he came back from that first expedition of his which closed with the finding of Livingstone. You remember how he would break out at the meetings of the British Association, and find fault with what people said, because Stanley had notions of his own, and could not contain them. They had to come out or break him up--and so he would go round and address geographical societies. He was always on the warpath in those days, and people always had to have Stanley contradicting their geography for them and improving it. But he always came back and sat drinking beer with me in the hotel up to two in the morning, and he was then one of the most civilized human beings that ever was. </p><p>I saw in a newspaper this evening a reference to an interview which appeared in one of the papers the other day, in which the interviewer said that I characterized Mr. Birrell's speech the other day at the Pilgrims' Club as ""bully."" Now, if you will excuse me, I never use slang to an interviewer or anybody else. That distresses me. Whatever I said about Mr. Birrell's speech was said in English, as good English as anybody uses. If I could not describe Mr. Birrell's delightful speech without using slang I would not describe it at all. I would close my mouth and keep it closed, much as it would discomfort me.  </p><p>Now that comes of interviewing a man in the first person, which is an altogether wrong way to interview him. It is entirely wrong because none of you, I, or anybody else, could interview a manâcould listen to a man talking any length of time and then go off and reproduce that talk in the first person. It can't be done. What results is merely that the interviewer gives the substance of what is said and puts it in his own language and puts it in your mouth. It will always be either better language than you use or worse, and in my case it is always worse. I have a great respect for the English language. I am one of its supporters, its promoters, its elevators. I don't degrade it. A slip of the tongue would be the most that you would get from me. I have always tried hard and faithfully to improve my English and never to degrade it. I always try to use the best English to describe what I think and what I feel, or what I don't feel and what I don't think.  </p><p>I am not one of those who in expressing opinions confine themselves to facts. I don't know anything that mars good literature so completely as too much truth. Facts contain a deal of poetry, but you can't use too many of them without damaging your literature. I love all literature, and as long as I am a doctor of literatureâI have suggested to you for twenty years I have been diligently trying to improve my own literature, and now, by virtue of the University of Oxford, I mean to doctor everybody else's.  </p><p>Now I think I ought to apologize for my clothes. At home I venture things that I am not permitted by my family to venture in foreign parts. I was instructed before I left home and ordered to refrain from white clothes in England. I meant to keep that command fair and clean, and I would have done it if I had been in the habit of obeying instructions, but I can't invent a new process in life right away. I have not had white clothes on since I crossed the ocean until now.  </p><p>In these three or four weeks I have grown so tired of gray and black that you have earned my gratitude in permitting me to come as I have. I wear white clothes in the depth of winter in my home, but I don't go out in the streets in them. I don't go out to attract too much attention. I like to attract some, and always I would like to be dressed so that I may be more conspicuous than anybody else.  </p><p>If I had been an ancient Briton, I would not have contented myself with blue paint, but I would have bankrupted the rainbow. I so enjoy gay clothes in which women clothe themselves that it always grieves me when I go to the opera to see that, while women look like a flower-bed, the men are a few gray stumps among them in their black evening dress. These are two or three reasons why I wish to wear white clothes: When I find myself in assemblies like this, with everybody in black clothes, I know I possess something that is superior to everybody else's. Clothes are never clean. You don't know whether they are clean or not, because you can't see.  </p><p>Here or anywhere you must scour your head every two or three days or it is full of grit. Your clothes must collect just as much dirt as your hair. If you wear white clothes you are clean, and your cleaning bill gets so heavy that you have to take care. I am proud to say that I can wear a white suit of clothes without a blemish for three days. If you need any further instruction in the matter of clothes I shall be glad to give it to you. I hope I have convinced some of you that it is just as well to wear white clothes as any other kind. I do not want to boast. I only want to make you understand that you are not clean.  </p><p>As to age, the fact that I am nearly seventy-two years old does not clearly indicate how old I am, because part of every day it is with me as with you, you try to describe your age, and you cannot do it. Sometimes you are only fifteen; sometimes you are twenty-five. It is very seldom in a day that I am seventy-two years old. I am older now sometimes than I was when I used to rob orchards; a thing which I would not do to-dayâif the orchards were watched. I am so glad to be here to- night. I am so glad to renew with the Savages that now ancient time when I first sat with a company of this club in London in 1872. That is a long time ago. But I did stay with the Savages a night in London long ago, and as I had come into a very strange land, and was with friends, as I could see, that has always remained in my mind as a peculiarly blessed evening, since it brought me into contact with men of my own kind and my own feelings.  </p><p>I am glad to be here, and to see you all again, because it is very likely that I shall not see you again. It is easier than I thought to come across the Atlantic. I have been received, as you know, in the most delightfully generous way in England ever since I came here. It keeps me choked up all the time. Everybody is so generous, and they do seem to give you such a hearty welcome. Nobody in the world can appreciate it higher than I do. It did not wait till I got to London, but when I came ashore at Tilbury the stevedores on the dock raised the first welcomeâa good and hearty welcome from the men who do the heavy labor in the world, and save you and me having to do it. They are the men who with their hands build empires and make them prosper. It is because of them that the others are wealthy and can live in luxury. They received me with a ""Hurrah!"" that went to my heart. They are the men that build civilization, and without them no civilization can be built. So I came first to the authors and creators of civilization, and I blessedly end this happy meeting with the Savages who destroy it. </p></blockquote> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Clemens was the notable literary figure in Berlin that winter, the center of every great gathering. He was entertained by the Kaiser earlier in the month, and shown many special attentions by Germans of every rank. One night, after delivering a lecture in a hot room, he contracted a severe cold, driving to a ball at General von Versen's, and a few days after was confined to his bed with pneumonia. </p>   <p><strong>Accompanied by a postcard addressed to Clemens from the aforementioned A. F. Kingscote, sent two days before Clemens' letter:</strong></p>   <blockquote><p><em>[To:] S. Clemens Esqre (alias Mark Twain) <br/>Hotel Royal, Berlin</em></p><p><em>Oxford Union Society, Oxford </em></p><p><em>I sincerely trust that you are getting better. My letter of the 4th reached you quite safely, I trust?

F. Kingscote</em></p></blockquote>   <p>Curiously, Clemens' letter to his publishers, no doubt written during his time of bed rest, asks them to find out who Mr. Kingscote is even though Kingscote's postcard inquiring about Clemens' health suggests a level of familiarity with him. </p>   <p>In very good condition, with intersecting folds, several professional repairs to tears on reverse, scattered toning, creasing, and wrinkling, and a vertical fold through a single letter of signature.</p> <p>The photo shown here was taken of Clemens in Berlin 1892, about the time he wrote this letter <em>(Photo not included in sale, used only for timeline reference).</em></p> <p>Â </p>   <p>COA from PSA/DNA. <meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]-->Moreover, all Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In full: ""Enclosed please find the final installment of rent for this delightful house, which I hope we are not occupying for the last time."" </strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>SAMUEL LANGHORNE CLEMENS</strong> (1835-1910), better known by the pen name Mark Twain, was an American humorist, satirist, lecturer and writer. Twain is most noted for his novels <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em>, which has since been called the Great American Novel, and <em>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</em>.</p>   <p>Clemens fell into a deep depression following the death of his favorite daughter Susy in 1896, likely accounting for the mourning stationery. In good condition, with staining and soiling (evidently from exposure to moisture; touching several words of text; lightly touching signature) and slight scattered fading of ink. Integral leaf intact.</p> <p>Though Clemens became wealthy as a result of his major literary works, later efforts were not as rewarding. He had vigorously begun to write articles and commentary with diminishing returns to pay the bills and keep his business interests afloat, but eventually filed for bankruptcy in 1894. Clemens and his family spent most of the 1890s in Europe seeking lower living costs, as he lectured and wrote his way out of debt. When he finally returned to New York in 1900, his debts fully repaid and his income back up in the $90,000 range, the event was regarded as a national triumph.</p>   <p>He installed his family in a rented house, still standing, at <strong>14 West 10th Street</strong> in Greenwich Village (the address on the stationery Clemens used for this item, though struck-through since he had just moved to <strong>Wave Hill House</strong>), and settled down to bask in the admiration of his countrymen. Two years later, for the sake of his wife Livy's failing health, they moved to <strong>Wave Hill</strong>, a magnificent fieldstone mansion (also still standing) overlooking the Hudson in Riverdale, where Clemens had written this letter.</p>   <p>Wave Hill is now a renowned New York landmark and environmental center. Theodore Roosevelt's family rented Wave Hill during the summers of 1870 and â71, when the future president was a youth of 12 and 13. Mark Twain leased the estate from 1901-1903, setting up a treehouse parlor in the branches of a chestnut tree on the lawn. Of winter at Wave Hill he wrote, <em>""I believe we have the noblest roaring blasts here I have ever known on land; they sing their hoarse song through the big tree-tops with a splendid energy that thrills me and stirs me and uplifts me and makes me want to live always."" </em></p>   <p><strong><em>Curious side note:</em></strong> In a 2002 <em><a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E3DC113CF934A15753C1A9649C8B63&amp;fta=y"">New York Times </a></em><a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E3DC113CF934A15753C1A9649C8B63&amp;fta=y"">FYI Column</a> just before Halloween, a reader had inquired as to ""the most haunted house in the city."" Writer Ed Boland, Jr., replied:</p>   <blockquote><p>""... probably no one site is as notorious as <strong>14 West 10th Street</strong>, west of Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. </p><p>In 1974, a former actress turned psychic, Jan Bryant Bartell, detailed her experiences living in the house in the book ''Spindrift: Spray From a Psychic Sea.'' Ms. Bartell claimed that a number of tenants had died mysteriously and that the building was haunted by spirits. </p><p>One ghost who supposedly haunts No. 14 is Mark Twain, who lived there from 1900 to 1901. According to Ms. Bartell, a mother and daughter living on the ground floor in the 1930's found an old man with white hair in the living room one evening. When the startled mother asked him who he was, the figure replied, ''My name is Clemens, and I has a problem here I gotta settle'' and disappeared. (Twain, known more formally as Samuel L. Clemens, had died in Connecticut in 1910.)...</p></blockquote>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Exceptional provenance from the esteemed collection of a pioneer in autograph dealers, Charles Hamilton, with his Certificate of Authenticity on reverse.</p> <h4>And if you ever wondered (or forgot) HOW he chose that name...</h4> <p>Clemens maintained that his primary pen name came from his years working on Mississippi riverboats, where two fathoms, a depth indicating ""safe water"" for the boat to float over, was measured on the sounding line. A fathom is a maritime unit of depth, equivalent to two yards (1.8 m); ""twain"" is an archaic term for ""two"". The riverboatman's cry was ""mark twain"" or, more fully, ""by the mark twain"", meaning ""according to the mark [on the line], [the depth is] two [fathoms]"", that is, ""there are 12 feet (3.7 m) of water under the boat and it is safe to pass"".</p> <p>Twain claimed that his famous pen name was not entirely his invention. In Life on the Mississippi, he wrote:</p> <blockquote><p>""Captain Isaiah Sellers was not of literary turn or capacity, but he used to jot down brief paragraphs of plain practical information about the river, and sign them ""MARK TWAIN,"" and give them to the New Orleans Picayune. They related to the stage and condition of the river, and were accurate and valuable; ... At the time that the telegraph brought the news of his death, I was on the Pacific coast. I was a fresh new journalist, and needed a nom de guerre; so I confiscated the ancient mariner's discarded one, and have done my best to make it remain what it was in his hands-a sign and symbol and warrant that whatever is found in its company may be gambled on as being the petrified truth; how I have succeeded, it would not be modest in me to say.""</p></blockquote> <p>Twain's version of the story regarding his nom de plume is not without detractors and has been called into question by biographer George Williams III, the Territorial Enterprise newspaper and Purdue University's Paul Fatout. These sources claim that ""mark twain"" refers to a running bar tab that Twain would regularly incur while drinking at John Piper's saloon in Virginia City, Nevada.</p>  ",1901,sold,1,FALSE,3612,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/B15EFF8D-1517-6111-28E9BBFC14FD9BE5.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8C82E5F9-1517-6111-2800C7BB439E998C.png",Samuel Clemens

He was  freed from slavery as a child, gained an education, and as a young man was  appointed to lead a teachers' college for blacks. From this position of  leadership he rose into a nationally prominent role as spokesman for African  Americans.In addition to his achievements in astronomy and his leadership  at MIT, Henry Pritchett had a long and illustrious career, including involvement  with the  <strong>Carnegie  Endowment for International Peace</strong> , and served as a trustee for   <strong>Carnegie  Institute</strong>   <strong>of Washington</strong> . Pritchett Lounge, on the second  floor of Walker Memorial at MIT is named in his honor.  <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">The clipped image at left shows the provenance  of this wonderful letter as it appeared in the January 10, 1901 edition of <em><strong>The Tech</strong></em>, MIT's oldest and largest  newspaper, and the oldest newspaper published on the Web (viewable online at <a _fcksavedurl=""http://www-tech.mit.edu/V20/PDF/N14.pdf"" _fckxhtmljob=""1"" href=""http://www-tech.mit.edu/V20/PDF/N14.pdf"" target=""_blank"">MIT's  The Tech Archives</a>).</p>   <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">As this is currently unframed, also  included is a <strong>beautiful photograph of Booker T.

Previously folded three times, presumably to fit an envelope, the document has evidently been laid flat for most of its life, accounting for its fine condition.</p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">As this is currently unframed, also  included is a <strong>beautiful photograph of Booker T.  Washington</strong>, pensively seated with a magazine in his lap, dated 1903âabout the same time he wrote this letterâfrom the archives of the Library of Congress. Measuring approximately 5x7, this fine image has been exquisitely reproduced on HahnemÃ¼hle Smooth Fine Art paper using specialty pigment inks designed to resist fading up to 200 years, and would make an excellent enhancement to an archivally framed presentation.</p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1""><strong>Booker T. </strong><strong>Washington</strong> (1856-1915) was an American educator, author and leader of the African American community. He was freed from slavery as a child, gained an education, and as a young man was appointed to lead a teachers' college for blacks. From this position of leadership he rose into a nationally prominent role as spokesman for African Americans. </p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">Â </p> <p _fckxhtmljob=""1"">All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

American author, essayist, educator, and lexicographer; his groundbreaking dictionary was largely responsible for standardizing American English and distinguishing it from British English.</p> <p>In 1782-83 Noah Webster taught in a classical school at Goshen, New York, and became convinced of the need of better textbooks of English. As a teacher, he had come to dislike American elementary schools. They could be overcrowded, with up to seventy children of all ages crammed into one-room schoolhouses, poorly staffed with untrained teachers, and poorly equipped with no desks and unsatisfactory textbooks that came from England. Webster thought that Americans should learn from American books, so he began writing a three volume compendium, <em>A Grammatical Institute of the English Language</em>. The work consisted of a speller (published in 1783), a grammar (published in 1784), and a reader (published in 1785). His goal was to provide a uniquely American approach to training children. His most important improvement, he claimed, was to rescue ""our native tongue"" from ""the clamor of pedantry"" that surrounded English grammar and pronunciation. He complained that the English language had been corrupted by the British aristocracy, which set its own standard for proper spelling and pronunciation. Webster rejected the notion that the study of Greek and Latin must precede the study of English grammar. The appropriate standard for the American language, argued Webster, was, ""the same republican principles as American civil and ecclesiastical constitutions"", which meant that the people-at-large must control the language; popular sovereignty in government must be accompanied by popular usage in language. ""The truth is general custom is the rule of speaking-and every deviation from this must be wrong."" <br/><br/>The Speller was arranged so that it could be easily taught to students, and it progressed by age. From his own experiences as a teacher, Webster thought the Speller should be simple and gave an orderly presentation of words and the rules of spelling and pronunciation. He believed students learned most readily when he broke a complex problem into its component parts and had each pupil master one part before moving to the next. Ellis argues that Webster anticipated some of the insights currently associated with Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development. Webster said that children pass through distinctive learning phases in which they master increasingly complex or abstract tasks. Therefore, teachers must not try to teach a three-year-old how to read; they could not do it until age five. He organized his speller accordingly, beginning with the alphabet and moving systematically through the different sounds of vowels and consonants, then syllables, then simple words, then more complex words, then sentences.<br/><br/>The speller was originally entitled <em>The First Part of the Grammatical Institute of the English Language</em>. Over the course of 385 editions in his lifetime, the title was changed in 1786 to <em>The American Spelling Book</em>, and again in 1829 to <em>The Elementary Spelling Book</em>. Most people called it the ""Blue-Backed Speller"" because of its blue cover, and for the next one hundred years, Webster's book taught children how to read, spell, and pronounce words. It was the most popular American book of its time; by 1861, it was selling a million copies per year, and its royalty of less than one cent per copy was enough to sustain Webster in his other endeavors. Some consider it to be the first dictionary created in the United States, and it helped create the popular contests known as spelling bees.<br/><br/>Slowly, he changed the spelling of words, such that they became 'Americanized'. He chose s over c in words like defense; he changed the re to er in words like center; he dropped one of the Ls in traveller; at first, he kept the u in words like colour or favour, but he dropped it in later editions.<br/><br/>Unauthorized printing of his books, and disparate copyright laws that varied among the thirteen states, led Webster to champion the federal copyright law that was successfully passed in 1790.<br/><br/>In 1806, Webster published his first dictionary, <em>A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language</em>. The following year, at the age of 43, Webster began writing an expanded and comprehensive dictionary, <em>An American Dictionary of the English Language</em>, which would take twenty-seven years to complete. To supplement the documentation of the etymology of the words, Webster learned twenty-six languages, including Anglo-Saxon and Sanskrit. Webster hoped to standardize American speech, since Americans in different parts of the country spelled, pronounced, and used words differently. </p>  ",1802,sold,1,FALSE,3286,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/EFF2CA7D-3048-C0CE-55D60BA0127DEA35.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/EFF1FFEA-3048-C0CE-5571454ABA1803D5.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/EFF26897-3048-C0CE-552454D31380A209.jpg",

Significantly, this certificate was issued in 1865 to one of New England's most prominent citizens, Mr. Henry C. Bowen of New York. </strong>A hugely successful silk merchant, in 1845 Bowen commissioned Joseph C. Wells, the English-born architect who designed Bowen's Plymouth Church in Brooklyn Heights, to design a summer home for the family in Woodstock. Wells designed a stunning five-bedroom, 6,000-square-foot Gothic Revival cottage, called Roseland Cottage by the family, was completed in the fall of 1846.</p><p>While Roseland Cottage was primarily a family country retreat, during the second half of the nineteenth century the Bowens more frequently entertained distinguished guests and hosted large festivities at Roseland Cottage. Three United States presidents, Ulysses S. Grant, Benjamin Harrison, and Rutherford B. Hayes, and three past and future presidential candidates, John C. Fremont, James G. Blaine, and William McKinley, in addition to a long list of senators, congressman, governors, and other political, literary, and social luminaries, made their way to Woodstock to participate in Bowen's renowned Fourth of July celebrations. Eventually these events grew so large that Bowen purchased an approximately sixty-acre parcel in Woodstock and developed an elegant public park, replete with gilded fountains, decorative statuary, windmill, boathouse, and private bungalows, in which to host his Fourth of July celebrations. The park, named Roseland Park, was first opened in 1876 and in accordance with Bowen's will is still open to the public today.</p><p style=""font-size: 1em"">Roseland Cottage, designated a National Historic Landmark in 1992, remains one of the nation's best preserved examples of Gothic Revival architecture.

Because the monarch is the head of the Church of England and is also expected to set an example of the British way of life, King Edward's family disapproved of his continued liaison with Mrs. Simpson. Their vacation together aboard a yacht in the summer of 1936 was sensationally reported in the foreign press and caused considerable anxiety in British royal and governmental circles. The crisis began in October 1936, when Wallis Simpson was granted a decree <em>nisi</em>-a divorce that would become final in six months-from Ernest Simpson, a British shipping executive. A few weeks later the king told the prime minister, the staid Conservative Stanley Baldwin, that he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson and that if he could not do so and remain king, he was ""prepared to go.""</p>   <p>His brief reign was just 326 days. In a radio speech after renouncing the throne, Edward remarked ""I have found it impossible to carry on the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge the duties of king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."" </p>   <p>Following his abdication Simpson and Edward were married in France on 3 June 1937.

This teletype was received onboard the <em>USS Denver</em>, a Cleveland-class light cruiser, following her return from Okinawa hunting Japanese ships off the China coast. An exceedingly rare and important historical document to have survived intact, especially from one of the American naval vessels that saw significant action during the war.

It is as a team we have worked and fought to the victorious conclusion of the war. As we turn now from the vital tasks of war I call upon all members of the Naval Services to rededicate their efforts with the same courage devotion to duty and united spirit to the work of resolving the great problems of peace.

By the end of July 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy was incapable of conducting major operations and an Allied invasion of Japan was imminent. Together with the British Empire and China, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945âthe alternative being ""prompt and utter destruction.""</p> <p>On August 6, 1945, at 8:15 AM local time, the United States detonated an atomic bomb over the Japanese city of Hiroshima. Sixteen hours later, American President Harry S. Truman called again for Japan's surrender, warning them to ""expect a rain of ruin from the air, the like of which has never been seen on this earth."" On August 9, 1945, the United States dropped a second atomic bomb, this time on the Japanese city of Nagasaki. Following these events, Emperor Hirohito intervened and ordered the Supreme Council for the Direction of the War to accept the terms the Allies had set down in the Potsdam Declaration for ending the war. After several more days of behind-the-scenes negotiations and a failed coup d'Ã©tat, Emperor Hirohito gave a recorded radio address across the Empire on August 15. In the radio address he announced the surrender of Japan to the Allies.</p>  ",1945,sold,1,FALSE,3875,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/049402DE-1517-6111-28107DD76F81F1C9.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/04947445-1517-6111-28BFBF7F32634B25.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/78FB2D92-1517-6111-28429FA2875C7E3C.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/78FC67F4-1517-6111-2866421308FB48CE.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/78FCDAD2-1517-6111-2868858ED77F56EA.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/78FD3FC5-1517-6111-287BC2B4837C0499.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/78FDB0EE-1517-6111-286812293B00B52C.jpg",

His work includes original and innovative examples of many different building types, including offices, churches, schools, sky scrapers, hotels, and museums. Wright also often designed many of the interior elements of his buildings, such as the furniture and stained glass.</p>   <p>Wright authored 20 books and many articles, and was a popular lecturer in the United States and in Europe. His colorful personal life often made headlines, most notably for the 1914 fire and murders at his Taliesin studio.</p>   <p>Already well known during his lifetime, Wright was recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as ""the greatest American architect of all time"".</p>   <p><strong>JAROSLAV JOSEPH POLIVKA</strong> (aka J.

He then studied at the Federal Polytechnic Institute in Zurich, Switzerland and at the Prague Institute of Technology, where he earned a doctoral degree in 1917. After serving in First World War, he opened his own architectural and engineering office in Prague and developed his skills in stress analysis of reinforced concrete, pre-stressed reinforced concrete and steel structures. Polivka became an expert in photo-elastic stress analysis, a technique that examines small-scale transparent models in polarized light.</p>   <p>In 1946 Polivka began to work with Frank Lloyd Wright collaborating together on several major projects until Wright's death in 1959. For Wright's projects Polivka performed stress analyses and investigations of specific building materials. They worked on a total of seven projects, two of which were built: the Johnson Wax Research Tower, 1946-1951 at Racine Wisconsin and the Guggenheim Museum, 1946-1959 in New York. Their other well-known design proposal was the reinforced concrete Butterfly Bridge (proposed at a world record span of 1000-ft) at the Southern Crossing of the San Francisco Bay (1949-52).</p>   <p>It was not until 1946 that Polivka began to work with Frank Lloyd Wright, but once they established a business partnership, the two men worked together until Wright's death in 1959. Architect Ivan Margolius gives an account of the first interaction between Wright and Polivka in his book, <em>Architects + Engineers = Structures.</em> (Chichester, West Sussex : Wiley-Academy, 2002):</p>   <blockquote><p>""In 1946 Wright wrote an article in Architectural Forum about the difficulties he had with the steel company engineers who condemned his Fallingwater house (1934-1937) structural design. Wright wrote to Edgar Kaufmann, his client, saying: 'I should like this box [with this letter] put under the corner stone of your house when the cornerstone is laid. I want this done so that when the house is torn down, 2,000 years from now, people will learn what complete damn fools these engineers are!' Prague-born structural engineer Jaroslav Josef Polivka (1886-1960) responded to the article by sending Wright an enthusiastic letter: 'I am admiring you as an engineer, although, according to a quotation in the last Forum issue, these engineers are complete damn fools. You may be right since the engineers in their structural conceptions are very seldom guided by eternal laws of the Nature ... The average engineer knows only beams, girders, columns and any deviation from his every day tools is considered as unusual, crazy, or dangerous.' The letter brought in return Wright's invitation to Taliesin and opened a professional relationship that lasted until Wright's death.""</p></blockquote>   <p>Additional biographical material and life chronology on Mr. Polivka can be found in the excellent archives of the <a href=""http://libweb1.lib.buffalo.edu:8080/findingaids/view?docId=ead/archives/ubar_ms0048.xml"" target=""_blank"">State University of New York at Buffalo</a>. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Particularly noted for his study of cities and urban architecture, he had a tremendously broad career as a writer that also included a period as an influential literary critic. Mumford was influenced by the work of Scottish theorist Sir Patrick Geddes. Mumford was also a contemporary and friend of <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/frank-lloyd-wright-signed-letter-jj-polivka-signature-autographed-1952"">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, Frederic J. Osborn, Edmund N. Bacon, and Vannevar Bush.</p>   <p>Mumford believed that what defined humanity, what set human beings apart from other animals, was not primarily our use of tools (technology) but our use of language (symbols). He was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity, and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex. He had hopes for a continuation of this process of information ""pooling"" in the world as humanity moved into the future.</p>   <p>Mumford's earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary American literary criticism. <em>The Golden Day</em> contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850's American transcendentalist authors and <em>Herman Melville: A study of His Life and Vision</em> effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of Herman Melville. Soon after, with the book <em>The Brown Decades</em>, he began to establish himself as an authority in US architecture and urban life, which he interpreted in a social context.</p>   <p>In his early writings on urban life, Mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and mass communication to build a better world for all humankind. He would later take a more pessimistic stance. His early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of Henry Hobson Richardson, Louis Sullivan and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/frank-lloyd-wright-signed-letter-jj-polivka-signature-autographed-1952"">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Anonymous,Anonymous,,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/book-of-hours-illuminated-leaf-flanders-late-medieval-age/,14th Century Illuminated Leaf from Book of Hours,"  <p><strong>From Flanders circa 1350 comes this stunning illuminated miniature leaf on virgin vellum from a 14th-century Book of Hours, in pristine condition. Thirteen lines of text on each side featuring eight gilded letters, written in Gothic Latin script with brown ink and flawless burnished gold initials.</strong> Leaf measures 6.5"" x 4.5"" (15.5mm x 11.4mm) with the written space at 3"" x 2"" (7.6mm x 5mm).</p> <p>In the 14th century the Book of Hours overtook the Psalter as the most common vehicle for lavish illumination. This partly reflected the increasing dominance of illumination both commissioned and executed by laymen rather than monastic clergy. From the late 14th century a number of royal figures began to collect luxury illuminated manuscripts for their decorations, a fashion that spread across Europe from the Valois courts of France and the Burgundy, as well as Prague under Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and later Wenceslaus. A generation later, Duke Philip the Good of Burgundy was the most important collector of manuscripts, with several of his circle also collecting. It was during this period that Flanders overtook Paris as the leading force in illumination, a position it retained until the terminal decline of the illuminated manuscript in the early 16th century.</p> <p>The application of gold leaf or dust to an illumination is a very detailed process that only the most skilled illuminators can undertake and successfully achieve. The first detail an illuminator considered when dealing with gold was whether to use gold leaf or specks of gold that could be applied with a brush. When working with gold leaf the pieces would be hammered and thinned until they were ""thinner than the thinnest paper."" The use of this type of leaf allowed for numerous areas of the text to be outlined in gold. Illuminators had to be especially meticulous when applying gold leaf to the manuscript, since the careless implementing of gold could ruin the labor already placed in the illumination, thus causing the entire folio to be discarded. By adding richness and depth to the manuscript, the use of gold in illuminations created pieces of art that are highly valued today.<br/></p> <p align=""center"" style=""text-align: left"">Â <img alt=""The Black Death in the Late Medieval Era"" class=""img-responsive"" height=""292"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/FEB936A5-1517-6111-28FA23703F458593.png"" title=""The Black Death in the Late Medieval Era"" width=""400""/></p> <p align=""center"" style=""text-align: left""><strong>STEP BACK IN TIME 650 YEARS</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Just imagine: </em></strong>As this beautiful leaf was being written by some long-forgotten scribe, the Late Middle Ages were marked by difficulties and calamities such as famine, plague, and war, which significantly diminished the population of Western Europe.

H. Auden, was an Anglo-American poet, regarded by many as one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. His work is noted for its stylistic and technical achievements, its engagement with moral and political issues, and its variety of tone, form and content. The central themes of his poetry are love, politics and citizenship, religion and morals, and the relationship between unique human beings and the anonymous, impersonal world of nature.</p>   <p>Auden published about four hundred poems, including seven long poems (two of them book-length). His poetry was encyclopedic in scope and method, ranging in style from obscure twentieth-century modernism to the lucid traditional forms such as ballads and limericks, from doggerel through haiku and villanelles to a ""Christmas Oratorio"" and a baroque eclogue in Anglo-Saxon meters. The tone and content of his poems ranged from pop-song clichÃ©s to complex philosophical meditations, from the corns on his toes to atoms and stars, from contemporary crises to the evolution of society.</p>   <p>He also wrote more than four hundred essays and reviews about literature, history, politics, music, religion, and many other subjects. He collaborated on plays with Christopher Isherwood and on opera libretti with Chester Kallman, worked with a group of artists and filmmakers on documentary films in the 1930s and with the New York Pro Musica early music group in the 1950s and 1960s. About collaboration he wrote in 1964: ""collaboration has brought me greater erotic joy . . . than any sexual relations I have had"".</p>   <p>By the time of Auden's death in 1973 he had attained the status of a respected elder statesman. The Encyclopaedia Britannica notes that ""by the time of Eliot's death in 1965 ... a convincing case could be made for the assertion that Auden was indeed Eliot's successor, as Eliot had inherited sole claim to supremacy when Yeats died in 1939"". With some exceptions, British critics tended to treat his early work as his best, while American critics tended to favor his middle and later work. Unlike other modern poets, his reputation did not decline after his death, and Joseph Brodsky wrote that his was ""the greatest mind of the twentieth century"".</p>   <p>Auden's popularity and familiarity suddenly increased after his <em>Funeral Blues</em> (""Stop all the clocks"") was read aloud in the film <em>Four Weddings and a Funeral</em> (1994); subsequently, a pamphlet edition of ten of his poems, <em>Tell Me the Truth About Love</em>, sold more than 275,000 copies. After September 11, 2001, his poem <em>September 1, 1939</em> was widely circulated and frequently broadcast.</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Carlos Baker, Carlos,Baker,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/ernest-hemingway-selected-letters-signed-carlos-baker/,Signed Limited Edition of Hemingway's Selected Letters,"  <p><strong>A fine limited edition copy of <em>Ernest Hemingway's Selected Letters: 1917-1961</em>. Signed by editor Carlos Baker, #268 of 500 copies. In mint condition, protected by acetate dust jacket and brown silk slipcase with satin bookmark, signed by editor Carlos Baker. </strong>Minor shelfware at base, and silk run lines on sides as in photo of slipcase, else fine.<strong><br/></strong></p> <p>While many people are familiar with the public image of Hemingway and the legendary accounts of his life, few knew him as an intimate. With this collection of letters, presented for the first time as a Scribner Classic, a new Hemingway emerges. Ranging from 1917 to 1961, this generous selection of nearly six hundred letters is, in effect, both a self-portrait and an autobiography. In his own words, Hemingway candidly reveals himself to a wide variety of people: family, friends, enemies, editors, translators, and almost all the prominent writers of his day. In so doing he proves to be one of the most entertaining letter writers of all time.</p> <p>Carlos Baker has chosen letters that not only represent major turning points in Hemingway's career but also exhibit character, wit, and the writer's typical enthusiasm for hunting, fishing, drinking, and eating. A few are ingratiating, some downright truculent. Others present his views on writing and reading, criticize books by friend or foe, and discuss women, soldiers, politicians, and prizefighters. Perhaps more than anything, these letters show Hemingway's irrepressible humor, given far freer rein in his correspondence than in his books. An informal biography in letters, the product of forty-five years' living and writing, <em>Ernest Hemingway: Selected Letters</em> leaves an indelible impression of an extraordinary man. </p>

 Robert Barrett Browning, Robert,Barrett Browning,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/robert-browning-autograph-letter-signed-john-ruskin/,Autograph Letter Signed to Art Critic John Ruskin,"  <p><strong>Autograph Letter Signed by the English poet Robert Browning, dated August 12, 1884, on his personal stationery; 4.5"" x 7"" (11.5cm x 17.8cm). Addressed to the great Victorian art critic John Ruskin, who 44 years earlier had written a scathing review of one of Browning's earlier poetic works.</strong> In full:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Aug 12 1884</strong></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><strong>Dear Mr Ruskin,</strong></p><p><strong>	The accompanying letter was forwarded to me by its writer, my friend Mrs. Bloomfield Moore, with a request that I would insert the addrefs <em>(sic)</em> and add an authenticating word or two. Of the work mentioned, I know nothing: but I have had experience of Mrs. Moore's great love of art, and extraordinary munificence in purchasing pictures for presentation to the galleries of Philadelphia, Boston and New York. I hope you remember me as I shall ever remember you. </strong></p><p><strong>Being affectionately yours,<br/>Robert Browning</strong></p></blockquote> <p><em><strong>Robert Browning's Relationship with John Ruskin</strong></em><br/>In 1840 Browning published Sordello, a long narrative poem based on the murky history of the medieval Italian troubadour Sordello da Goito. The reviews were very harsh and it soon came to be known as the most incomprehensible poem of its time.  It gained a reputation as ""unintelligible"" and ""meaningless,"" establishing Browning as an obscure poet. The critic John Ruskin said the poem was ""...worse than the worst Alpine Glacier I ever crossed. Bright &amp; deep enough truly, but so full of clefts that half the journey has to be made with ladder &amp; hatchet."" Browning himself came to make light of the poem, saying it was ""praised by the units, cursed by the tens, unmeddled with by the hundreds."" Ezra Pound began the process of reversing this legacy when he declared it ""probably the greatest poem in English."" (<a href=""http://www.georgetowncollege.edu/departments/english/burch/robert_browning.htm"" target=""_blank"">Reference</a>)</p> <p>The extensive correspondence between John Ruskin and both Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning forms a fascinating exchange among three distinguished Victorian literary figures. As noted by University of Texas at Austin scholar, the late David deLaura, ""The relationship was initiated by Ruskin, who praised Mrs. Browning profusely in his [critical] works of the 1850s. The feeling between Ruskin and Mrs. Browning was obviously intense, and drew from Ruskin an intimacy concerning himself disproportionate to their limited encounters. Robert, though he obviously kept in the background and seems rarely to have sought out Ruskin, was provoked by Ruskin at least three times to a spirited defense of his art, and after Mrs. Browning's death in 1861 dealings between the two men continued to be rather frequent.""</p> <p><em><strong>This curious item appeared in The New York Times Saturday Review on August 19, 1899:</strong></em></p> <blockquote>The interest in Robert Browning will not be diminished in the least by the fact that his heart was in the keeping for a long time of a fair Philadelphian, whose death occurred in London a few months ago. For years Mrs. Bloomfield Moore of that city was the poet's most cherished idol. At one time the idea was rife that Mrs. Moore was engaged to be married to him. It is true that the deepest friendship existed between the poet and Mrs. Moore. That it did not result in marriage after the death of Elizabeth Barrett Browning was not due to Mr. Browning's reluctance to take an American bride. One of Mr. Browning's last works, ""Ferishta's Fancies,"" shows that he was capable in the last years of his life of writing the most passionate love lyrics. To those who are able to read between the lines these lyrics, in the language of Mrs. Moore, suggested that the poet was not as well satisfied with Platonic love as was the author of ""Agatha's Friendship,"" the novel that was published twenty-five years ago from Mrs. Moore's pen. The nature of Mrs. Moore's feelings for Browning was admirably expressed in one of her own poems, ""On the Heights,"" which was published a dozen years ago in London by the Remingtons. Mrs. Moore is the authority for this statement, which was originally made under her direction. Â© <em>The New York Times</em> </blockquote> <p><strong>ROBERT BROWNING</strong> (1812-1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of dramatic verse, especially dramatic monologues, made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. Browning's poetry was known to the cognoscenti from fairly early on in his life, but he remained relatively obscure as a poet till his middle age. (In the middle of the century, Tennyson was much better known.) In Florence he worked on the poems that eventually comprised his two-volume Men and Women, for which he is now well known; in 1855, however, when these were published, they made little impact. It was only after his wife's death, in 1861, when he returned to England and became part of the London literary scene, that his reputation started to take off.</p> <p><strong>JOHN RUSKIN</strong> (1819-1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, also an art patron, draughtsman, watercolorist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects ranging from geology to architecture, myth to ornithology, literature to education, and botany to political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. </p> <p><strong>CLARA (JESSUP) MOORE</strong> (1824-1899) was a distinguished poet, novelist and philanthropist. In 1842 she married Bloomfield Haines Moore, a prominent Philadelphia businessman. Clara was Robert Browning's closest friend and delivered the eulogy on the occasion of his death in December 1889.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Although he ultimately devoted himself almost exclusively to painting, he first trained as a sculptor, enrolling at the Roman Accademia di San Luca at age fifteen.<br/><br/>As a painter, Bompiani depicted historical, mythological, and religious subjects in a conservative, idealized style, making his figures physically perfect and giving them noble, spiritual expressions. An art historian at the time wrote that despite Bompiani's conservative approach, ""he showed himself open to new ideas and emancipated himself in his best work almost entirely from what was narrow and conventional in the style imposed upon him by his early training.""<br/><br/>In later years, Bompiani increasingly painted landscape watercolors. In the late 1870s, he began painting a series of portraits that included his wife and members of the Borghese family. He served as a professor and ultimately president of the Roman Accademia di San Luca.</p> <p>Â <img alt=""Roberto Bompiani - Two Pompeian Ladies"" height=""253"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2D38CE62-3048-C0CE-55DE4E4C50D2579B.jpg"" title=""Roberto Bompiani - Two Pompeian Ladies"" width=""410""/><br/>Â  <em>Two Pompeian Ladies</em></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

It can cut though solid metal, making it an ideal choice to cleave gold panels into more usable configurations for Goldfinger's operations.

The reviews were very harsh and it soon came to be known as the most incomprehensible poem of its time.  It gained a reputation as ""unintelligible"" and ""meaningless,"" establishing Browning as an obscure poet. The critic John Ruskin said the poem was ""...worse than the worst Alpine Glacier I ever crossed. Bright &amp; deep enough truly, but so full of clefts that half the journey has to be made with ladder &amp; hatchet."" Browning himself came to make light of the poem, saying it was ""praised by the units, cursed by the tens, unmeddled with by the hundreds.""

As noted by University of Texas at Austin scholar, the late David deLaura, ""The relationship was initiated by Ruskin, who praised Mrs. Browning profusely in his [critical] works of the 1850s. The feeling between Ruskin and Mrs. Browning was obviously intense, and drew from Ruskin an intimacy concerning himself disproportionate to their limited encounters. Robert, though he obviously kept in the background and seems rarely to have sought out Ruskin, was provoked by Ruskin at least three times to a spirited defense of his art, and after Mrs. Browning's death in 1861 dealings between the two men continued to be rather frequent.""</p> <p><em><strong>This curious item appeared in The New York Times Saturday Review on August 19, 1899:</strong></em></p> <blockquote>The interest in Robert Browning will not be diminished in the least by the fact that his heart was in the keeping for a long time of a fair Philadelphian, whose death occurred in London a few months ago. For years Mrs. Bloomfield Moore of that city was the poet's most cherished idol. At one time the idea was rife that Mrs. Moore was engaged to be married to him. It is true that the deepest friendship existed between the poet and Mrs. Moore. That it did not result in marriage after the death of Elizabeth Barrett Browning was not due to Mr. Browning's reluctance to take an American bride. One of Mr. Browning's last works, ""Ferishta's Fancies,"" shows that he was capable in the last years of his life of writing the most passionate love lyrics. To those who are able to read between the lines these lyrics, in the language of Mrs. Moore, suggested that the poet was not as well satisfied with Platonic love as was the author of ""Agatha's Friendship,"" the novel that was published twenty-five years ago from Mrs. Moore's pen. The nature of Mrs. Moore's feelings for Browning was admirably expressed in one of her own poems, ""On the Heights,"" which was published a dozen years ago in London by the Remingtons.

Unluckily there is but one day remaining, tomorrow, Tuesday-on which they can be seen, and I shall hardly hope to find you disengaged at so sudden a notice â should your visit be pofsible <em>(sic)</em>, it will be all the more welcome.</strong></p><p><strong>Believe me, dear sir,<br/>Yours very truly,<br/>Robert Browning</strong></p></blockquote> <p>In other correspondence of Browning's we have seen dated the same day, the studio mentioned hereâ11 Campden House Road Mewsâwas owned by Miss Henrietta Skerrett Montalba, the youngest daughter of the four artist daughters of Anthony Rubens and Emeline Montalba, in whose Venetian palazzo she lived for most of her life. She herself produced a terra cotta bust of Browning that was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1883.</p> <p><strong>ROBERT BROWNING</strong> (1812-1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of dramatic verse, especially dramatic monologues, made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. Browning's poetry was known to the cognoscenti from fairly early on in his life, but he remained relatively obscure as a poet till his middle age. (In the middle of the century, Tennyson was much better known.) In Florence he worked on the poems that eventually comprised his two-volume Men and Women, for which he is now well known; in 1855, however, when these were published, they made little impact. It was only after his wife's death, in 1861, when he returned to England and became part of the London literary scene, that his reputation started to take off.</p> <p><strong>ROBERT BARRETT BROWNING</strong>, known as Pen Browning, (1849-1912) was an English painter and sculptor. His career was moderately successful, but he is better known as the son and heir of the celebrated English poets, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barret Browning, of whose manuscripts and memorabilia he built up a substantial collection. He also bought and restored the Baroque palace Ca' Rezzonico in Venice, where his father died in 1889.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be   genuine.

(In the middle of the century, Tennyson was much better known.) In Florence he worked on the poems that eventually comprised his two-volume Men and Women, for which he is now well known; in 1855, however, when these were published, they made little impact. It was only after his wife's death, in 1861, when he returned to England and became part of the London literary scene, that his reputation started to take off. In 1868, after five years work, he completed and published the long blank-verse poem The Ring and the Book, and finally achieved really significant recognition. Based on a convoluted murder-case from 1690s Rome, the poem is composed of twelve books, essentially comprising ten lengthy dramatic poems narrated by the various characters in the story showing their individual take on events as they transpire, bookended by an introduction and conclusion by Browning himself. Extraordinarily long even by Browning's own standards (over twenty thousand lines), The Ring and the Book was the poet's most ambitious project and has been hailed as a tour de force of dramatic poetry. Published separately in four volumes from November 1868 through to February 1869, the poem was a huge success both commercially and critically, and finally brought Browning the renown he had sought and deserved for nearly forty years of work.</p>   <p>Browning's fame today rests mainly on his dramatic monologues, in which the words not only convey setting and action but also reveal the speaker's character. Unlike a soliloquy, the meaning in a Browning dramatic monologue is not what the speaker directly reveals but what he inadvertently ""gives away"" about himself in the process of rationalizing past actions, or ""special-pleading"" his case to a silent auditor in the poem. Rather than thinking out loud, the character composes a self-defense which the reader, as ""juror,"" is challenged to see through. Browning chooses some of the most debased, extreme and even criminally psychotic characters, no doubt for the challenge of building a sympathetic case for a character who doesn't deserve one and to cause the reader to squirm at the temptation to acquit a character who may be a homicidal psychopath. One of his more sensational dramatic monologues is Porphyria's Lover. The opening lines provide a sinister setting for the macabre events that follow. It is plain that the speaker is insane, as he strangles his lover with her own hair to try and preserve forever the moment of perfect love she has shown him.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

The naked, spread-eagled corpse of a senior curator is found in the Louvre's Grand Gallery, next to a mysterious message written in his blood. The discovery and the subsequent investigation plunge Harvard professor Robert Langdon into the heart of a centuries-old religious conspiracy. Assisted by the brilliant and beautiful Sophie Neveu, a French police cryptologist who also happens to be the curator's granddaughter, Langdon races to gather clues about an ancient goddess-worshipping cult--purportedly once led by Da Vinci himself--whose members hold the key to one of the most sacred legendary objects, the Holy Grail. Meanwhile, the couple must dodge both the police, who believe Langdon guilty of the curator's murder, and an albino assassin from an extremist Catholic sect who is desperate to prevent Langdon and Neveu from uncovering a secret that could rock Christianity to its very foundations. <em>THE DA VINCI CODE</em> is a blockbuster bestseller that has gained legions of fans around the globe; the extremely obsessed can even take a special tour in Paris that points out all the key locations in the storyline. The book also has many detractors who say they have found significant flaws in the religious and historical research upon which it is based. The debate reached such a fever pitch that the Vatican even appointed a Cardinal responsible for refuting the book's claims.

Despite his popularity in his heyday, today his name is known as a byword for bad writing.

His name lives on in the annual <strong>Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest</strong>, in which contestants have to supply terrible openings of imaginary novels, inspired by his novel <em>Paul Clifford</em>, which opens with the famous words:<strong><em>""It was a dark and stormy night"";</em></strong>or to give the sentence in its full glory:</p>   <blockquote><p><strong><em>""It was a dark and stormy night; the rain fell in torrentsâexcept at occasional intervals, when it was checked by a violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (for it is in London that our scene lies), rattling along the housetops, and fiercely agitating the scanty flame of the lamps that struggled against the darkness.""</em></strong></p></blockquote>   <p>Entrants in the contest seek to capture the rapid changes in point of view, the florid language, and the atmosphere of the full sentence.</p> <p align=""center""><img alt=""Edward Bulwer-Lytton"" height=""509"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9B578BD6-1517-6111-288DD1F7C06AA164.jpg"" title=""Edward Bulwer-Lytton"" width=""398""/> </p> All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He was the first black composer to be instrumental in the development of a characteristically American music and he helped to make black music available to classically trained artists both by introducing them to the music and by arranging the music in a more classical form.</p> <p>Through the 1920s and 1930s, Burleigh continued to promote the spirituals through publications, lectures, and arrangements. His life-long advocacy for the spiritual eclipsed his singing career, and his arrangements of art songs. With the success of Roland Hayes, Marian Anderson, and Paul Robeson, among others, his seminal role in carving out a place on America's recitals had been eclipsed. His many popular art songs from the early twentieth century have often been out of print since the composer's death. Nevertheless, Burleigh's position as one of America's most important composers from the early twentieth century remains.

The surviving cards are of particular historical interest because of the beauty and detail of the design, which was often executed in precious materials and often reproduce members of the Sforza and Visconti families in period garments and settings. Consequently, the cards also offer a glimpse of nobiliar life in Milan, which the two families called home since the 13th century. When commissioned by Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and by his successor Francesco Sforza, the cards were still known as <em>Trionfi</em> (""triumphs"", i.e. trump) cards, and used for everyday playing.Â </p> <p>The text surrounding the faithful reproductions of the original cards is, in effect, a short novel by Italo Calvino, commissioned by renowned Italian publisher Franco Maria Ricci for this edition: it concerns a group of travelers who are struck dumb and can communicate their stories only through Tarot cards, recounted and described by a narrator. (Calvino went on later to ""complete"" the story in a second part, built around another deck of Tarot, published in 1973.)</p> <p>The remaining original cards of the deck are dispersed today: a number of the cards are in the Pierpont Morgan Library, another group at the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, and others in a private collection, so Ricci's book is the only place where all existing cards are brought together.</p>  ",1975,350,0,FALSE,3554,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9BDF915A-1517-6111-283D8D971C00310C.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9C07468B-1517-6111-28CE6609111D8A30.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/0F8F0CE2-1517-6111-28EE17D8BD5FE4C5.png",Franco Maria Ricci

Over the course of the next few years, he became acquainted with everyone involved in the investigation and most of the residents of the small town.

It is considered the originator of the nonfiction novel and the forerunner of the New Journalism movement.</p> <p>The story weaves a complicated psychological story of two parolees who together commit a mass murder, an act they were not capable of individually. Capote's book also details the lives of the victims and the effect the crime had on where they lived. A large part of the story involves the dynamic psychological relationship of the two felons that culminated in this senseless crime. <em>In Cold Blood</em> is often regarded as a pioneering work of true crime.</p>  ",1965,sold,1,FALSE,3588,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/2932CC0F-1517-6111-280B7413DC71A4D7.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/292A33B9-1517-6111-28C104558ABA2965.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/292C291E-1517-6111-28890357E714AB88.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/2928EA52-1517-6111-28E3E324CDD0EBC2.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A30D0FCD-1517-6111-285DE28D2F74C26F.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A30C25EA-1517-6111-28B1AB1C88962C61.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A30CC297-1517-6111-2815F57DB1DF4169.jpg",

 Truman Capote, Truman,Capote,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/harper-lee-signed-autograph-signature-to-kill-a-mockingbird/,Autograph Sentiment Framed,"  <p><strong>A fine, bold autograph sentiment, framed with a fetching early photograph of the author. </strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>NELLE HARPER LEE</strong> (1926-) is an American author known for her 1960 novel <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>. She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom of the United States for her contribution to literature in 2007.</p>   <p>Having written several long stories, Harper Lee located an agent in November 1956. The following month at the East 50th townhouse of her friends Michael Brown and Joy Williams Brown, she received a gift of a year's wages with a note: ""You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas."" </p>   <p>Within a year, she had a first draft. Working with J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. editor Tay Hohoff, she completed <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> in the summer of 1959. Published July 11, 1960, the novel was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It remains a bestseller with more than 30 million copies in print. In 1999, it was voted ""Best Novel of the Century"" in a poll by the Library Journal.</p>   <p>Many details of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> are apparently autobiographical. Like Lee, the tomboy Scout is the daughter of a respected small-town Alabama attorney. The plot involves a legal case, the workings of which would have been familiar to Lee, who studied law. Scout's friend Dill is supposed to have been inspired by Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, <a href=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/category/All-Categories/name/Truman-Capote/view/items/"" target=""_blank"">Truman Capote</a>, while Lee is the model for a character in Capote's first novel, <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em>.</p>   <p>After completing <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Lee accompanied Capote to Holcomb, Kansas, to assist him in researching what they thought would be an article on a small town's response to the murder of a farmer and his family. Truman Capote expanded the material into his best-selling book, <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/truman-capote-in-cold-blood-signed-first-edition-book"" target=""_blank""><em>In Cold Blood</em></a> (1966).</p>   <p>Since publication of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Lee has granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances, and with the exception of a few short essays, has published no further writings. She did work on a second novel-<em>The Long Goodbye</em>-eventually filing it away unfinished. During the mid-1980s, she began a book of nonfiction about an Alabama serial murderer, but also put it aside when she was not satisfied. Her withdrawal from public life prompted unfounded speculation that new publications were in the works.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

A fine 1-page letter, dated April 11, 1890. Page is somewhat toned, but the text is fully visible and overall in good condition. Nicely framed with a fine caricature portrait. Dodgson sends thanks to his friend, the legendary British surgeon and pathologist, James Paget (1814-1899). In full: <br/><em><br/></em></p> <blockquote><em>""Dear Sir James Paget, I am very grateful for your kind letter and advice. Believe me yours most truly, C.L. Dodgson."" Â </em><br/></blockquote> <p><br/>Dr. Sir James Paget, best remembered for his discovery of ""Paget's disease,"" had several other diseases named after him, and is considered to be the founder of scientific medical pathology.</p> <p><strong>CHARLES L. DODGSON</strong> (1832-1898), better known by the pen name <strong>LEWIS CARROLL</strong>, was an English author, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon and photographer. His most famous writings are <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and its sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass</em> as well as the poems ""The Hunting of the Snark"" and ""Jabberwocky"", all considered to be within the genre of literary nonsense. His facility at word play, logic, and fantasy has delighted audiences ranging from children to the literary elite, and beyond this his work has become embedded deeply in modern culture, directly influencing many artists.<br/><br/>As Stuart Dodgson Collingwood noted in his book <em>The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll</em>: ""Mr. Dodgson was singularly fortunate in his friends; whenever he was in difficulties on any technical matters, whether of religion, law, medicine, art, or whatever it might be, he always had some one especially distinguished in that branch of study whose aid he could seek as a friend. In particular, the names of...Sir James Paget occur to me; to the latter Mr. Dodgson addressed many letters on questions of medicine and surgery--some of them intricate enough, but never too intricate to weary the unfailing patience of the great surgeon."" </p> <p>Â <img alt=""Charles Dodgson aka Lewis Carroll"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_07646380-3048-C0CE-556D06206BD2F8C2.jpg"" title=""Charles Dodgson aka Lewis Carroll"" width=""334""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Charles Dodgson, Charles,Dodgson,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/alices-adventures-under-ground-facsimile-edition/,Alice's Adventures Under Ground Facsimile Edition,"  <p>We have here what is, for us, somewhat of a mystery in the long annals of the publication of Lewis Carroll's classic, <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and in particular its original title, <em><strong>Alice's Adventures Under Ground</strong></em>. Those wishing a fuller history of the many editions may read further, but our copy appears to be a true facsimile of the original 1864 handwritten edition. It is just 90 pages long, and bears the original drawing of young Alice Liddellâwhich to our knowledge did not appear in any subsequent editions, having been replaced instead in 1886 with a pasted-down photograph of the real Alice. Ours is a <strong>collotype facsimile reproducing the original manuscript text, with 37 color and black and white illustrations by the author, 14 of them full-page drawings.</strong> Extensive research has yielded little about this particular edition, though it is quite old, printed on aged classic laid paper with toning throughout, with imperceptibly uneven, scallop-sheared edges and curious number stampings on various pages.

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, his friend reverend Canon Duckworth, and the sisters Alice, Lorina and Edith Liddell were on a boat trip on the river Isis (the local name for the stretch of the Thames that flows through Oxford) from Oxford to Godstow. Alice grew restless and begged Dodgson for a story ""with lots of nonsense in it"". Dodgson began, and invented the story while he was telling it. Much of the story was based on a picnic a couple of weeks earlier when they had been caught in the rain.</p> <p>Several times Dodgson tried to break off the story, but the children were not to be put off. They didn't return at the Deanery until late in the evening. On two other boat trips, Dodgson continued the series of ""Alice stories"".</p> <p>This is how Reverend Duckworth described the trip afterwards:</p> <blockquote><p><em>""I rowed stroke and he rowed bow (the three little girls sat in the stern) ... and the story was actually composed over my shoulder for the benefit of Alice Liddell, who was acting as 'cox' of our gig ... I remember turning round and saying, 'Dodgson, is this an extempore romance of yours?' And he replied, 'Yes, I'm inventing it as we go along.'""</em></p></blockquote> <p>In an article in the <em>New York Times</em> of April 4, 1928, Alice Liddell recalled:</p> <blockquote><p><em>""The beginning of Alice was told to me one summer afternoon, when the sun was so hot we landed in the meadows down the river, deserting the boat to take refuge in the only bit of shade to be found, which was under a newly made hayrick. Here from all three of us, my sisters and myself, came the old petition, 'Tell us a story' and Mr. Dodgson began it. Sometimes to tease us, Mr. Dodgson would stop and say suddenly, 'That's all till next time.' 'Oh,' we would cry, 'it's not bedtime already!' and he would go on. Another time the story would begin in the boat and Mr. Dodgson would pretend to fall asleep in the middle, to our great dismay.""</em></p></blockquote> <p>In the end Alice asked him to write the story down for her. According to Duckworth, Dodgson sat up all night and sketched an initial outline. Later he expanded it on a train journey with some adventures that had been told on other occasions. He copied it out again, more carefully and in a hand that Alice would find legible, and left spaces for pictures of his own drawings. He called it <em>Alice's Adventures Under Ground</em>. Dodgson presented the manuscript to Alice as a Christmas gift on November 26, 1864, with illustrations by the author himself, dedicating it as ""A Christmas Gift to a Dear Child in Memory of a Summer's Day"". Some speculate there was an earlier version that was destroyed later by Dodgson when he printed a more elaborate copy by hand. But before Alice received her copy, Dodgson was already preparing it for publication and expanding the 15,500-word original to 27,500 words, most notably adding the episodes about the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Tea-Party. </p> <p>In 1865, Dodgson's tale was published as <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> by ""Lewis Carroll"" with illustrations by John Tenniel. The first print run of 2,000 was held back because Tenniel objected to the print quality. A new edition, released in December of the same year, but carrying an 1866 date, was quickly printed. As it turned out, the original edition was sold with Dodgson's permission to the New York publishing house of Appleton. The binding for the Appleton <em>Alice</em> was virtually identical to the 1866 Macmillan <em>Alice</em>, except for the publisher's name at the foot of the spine. The title page of the Appleton <em>Alice</em> was an insert cancelling the original Macmillan title page of 1865, and bearing the New York publisher's imprint and the date 1866.</p> <p>The entire print run sold out quickly. <em>Alice</em> was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were Queen Victoria and the young Oscar Wilde. The book has never been out of print. <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> has been translated into 125 languages. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film.</p> <p>The book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, an alternative title popularized by the numerous stage, film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and its sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</em>.</p> <p>Â </p>  ",,inquire sold,0,TRUE,3503,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/172D185E-1517-6111-28A4E16F9E56AE46.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/17481751-1517-6111-2810D1BCE463927B.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1749023E-1517-6111-28DF595439DE4930.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1749D5BB-1517-6111-286C390EB373283A.png",Charles Dodgson

The binding for the Appleton <em>Alice</em> was virtually identical to the 1866 Macmillan <em>Alice</em>, except for the publisher's name at the foot of the spine. The title page of the Appleton <em>Alice</em> was an insert cancelling the original Macmillan title page of 1865, and bearing the New York publisher's imprint and the date 1866.</p> <p>The entire print run sold out quickly. <em>Alice</em> was a publishing sensation, beloved by children and adults alike. Among its first avid readers were Queen Victoria and the young Oscar Wilde. The book has never been out of print. <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> has been translated into 125 languages. There have now been over a hundred editions of the book, as well as countless adaptations in other media, especially theatre and film.</p> <p>The book is commonly referred to by the abbreviated title <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, an alternative title popularized by the numerous stage, film and television adaptations of the story produced over the years. Some printings of this title contain both <em>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</em> and its sequel <em>Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There</em>.</p> <p>Â </p>  ",,inquire sold,0,TRUE,3503,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/172D185E-1517-6111-28A4E16F9E56AE46.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/17481751-1517-6111-2810D1BCE463927B.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1749023E-1517-6111-28DF595439DE4930.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1749D5BB-1517-6111-286C390EB373283A.png",Charles Dodgson

Billy Baldwin writes intimately of Greta Garbo, Cole Porter, Mary Wells, Gilbert and Kitty Miller, Mrs. William Paley, Diana Vreeland, the two Jackies (Kennedy and Onassis), and others of his famous clients. </p> <p>Baldwin gives an irresistible account of the dark side of decorating-the impossible clients-in stories that are wickedly funny, not least because of Baldwin's perpetual astonishment in the face of the absurd (the Broadway producer who wants a sofa covered in a ""material I've never seen, ideally, one that has never ever been made,""Â or the playwright who orders him to buy false book spines to fill her bookcases. Through these pages teeming with invaluable decorating hints, the reader can trace the development of the theories that have made Baldwin the most sought after, admired, and imitated decorator on two continents.

CLARKE</strong> (1917-2008). Sir Arthur C. Clarke has over twenty million copies of his books in print, including three million of 2001, and has won every imaginable science fiction award, including the Science Fiction Writers of America Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement in 1986. A former radar officer for the RAF, he invented the Communication Satellite, garnering him a nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. In 1998 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for Services to Literature.</p>   <h3><strong>About 2001: A Space Odyssey</strong></h3> <p> When an enigmatic monolith is found buried on the moon, scientists are amazed to discover that it's at least 3 million years old. Even more amazing, after it's unearthed the artifact releases a powerful signal aimed at Saturn. What sort of alarm has been triggered? To find out, a manned spacecraft, the Discovery, is sent to investigate. Its crew is highly trained--the best--and they are assisted by a self-aware computer, the ultra-capable HAL 9000. But HAL's programming has been patterned after the human mind a little too well. He is capable of guilt, neurosis, even murder, and he controls every single one of Discovery's components. The crew must overthrow this digital psychotic if they hope to make their rendezvous with the entities that are responsible not just for the monolith, but maybe even for human civilization.<br/> <br/> Clarke wrote this novel while Stanley Kubrick created the film, the two collaborating on both projects. The novel is much more detailed and intimate, and definitely easier to comprehend. Even though history has disproved its ""predictions,"" it's still loaded with exciting and awe-inspiring science fiction.<br/> </p> <blockquote> ""Dazzling...wrenching, eerie, a mind-bender.""<em> â Time</em><br/><br/> ""Full of poetry, scientific imagination and typically wry Clarke wit.

This clothbound edition preserves the luxurious sensibility of the original with 22 extraordinary oversized daguerreotypes printed in rich tritone. Working with daguerreotype master Jerry Spagnoli to conquer the complexities of this venerable process, which yields images of astonishing detail and gravity, Chuck Close photographed many of the same artist-friends who have made regular appearances in his paintings over the years: Laurie Anderson, Lyle Ashton Harris, Cecily Brown, Gregory Crewdson, Carroll Dunham, Ellen Gallagher, Philip Glass, Bob Holman, Elizabeth Murray, Elizabeth Peyton, Andres Serrano, Cindy Sherman, James Siena, Lorna Simpson, Kiki Smith, James Turrell, Robert Wilson, Terry Winters, Lisa Yuskavage and himself. </p> <p>Each image is complemented by a poem on its subject by Bob Holman, the celebrated and widely published New York School poet who originated and hosted the famous Poetry Slams at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe and now runs the Bowery Poetry Club. With the counterpoint of Holman's engaging poetry, the collected work becomes a transfixing group portrait of Close's influential and highly creative circle of friends and colleagues, as well as an exploration of a challenging photographic medium. A traveling exhibition of the work will launch in November 2006 at the Aperture Gallery.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Signed,  </em></p><p><em>Jean Cocteau </em></p></blockquote>   <p>In his advice to Klemmer, Cocteau mentions Barbara Karinska, the prominent Russian costumer who designed the costumes for Cocteau's plays, as well as collaborating with such artistic luminaries as George Ballanchine, Balthus, Joan Miro, AndrÃ© Derain, and many others. </p> <p><strong>JEAN MAURICE EUGÃNE CLÃMENT COCTEAU</strong> (1889-1963) was a French poet, novelist, dramatist, designer, boxing manager, playwright and filmmaker. Along with other Surrealists of his generation (Jean Anouilh and RenÃ© Char for example) Cocteau grappled with the ""algebra"" of verbal codes old and new, <em>mise en scÃ¨ne</em> language and technologies of modernism to create a paradox: a classical avant-garde. His circle of associates, friends and lovers included Jean Marais, Henri Bernstein, Ãdith Piaf, whom he cast in one of his one act plays entitled <em>Le Bel Indifferent</em> in 1940, and Raymond Radiguet.</p> <p>Cocteau's work was played out in the theatrical world of the Grands Theatres, the Boulevards and beyond during the Parisian epoque he both lived through and helped define and create. His versatile, unconventional approach and enormous output brought him international acclaim. </p>   <p>In the 1930s, Cocteau had an unlikely affair with Princess Natalie Paley, the beautiful daughter of a Romanov grand duke and herself a fashion-plate, sometimes actress, model, and former wife of couturier Lucien Lelong. She became pregnant. To Cocteau's distress and Paley's life-long regret, the fetus was aborted. Cocteau's longest-lasting relationships were with the French actors Jean Marais and Edouard Dermit, whom Cocteau formally adopted. Cocteau cast Marais in <em>The Eternal Return</em> (1943), <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, <em>Ruy Blas</em> (1947) and <em>Orpheus</em> (1949).</p>   <p>In 1940, <em>Le Bel IndiffÃ©rent</em>, Cocteau's play written for and starring Ãdith Piaf, was enormously successful. He also worked with Pablo Picasso on several projects and was friends with most of the European art community. He struggled with an opium addiction for most of his adult life and was openly gay, though he had a few brief and complicated affairs with women other than Paley (including, some say, Piaf). He published a considerable amount of work criticizing homophobia.</p>   <p>Cocteau's films, most of which he both wrote and directed, were particularly important in introducing Surrealism into French cinema and influenced to a certain degree the upcoming French New Wave genre.</p>   <p>Cocteau is best known for his 1929 play <em>Les enfants terribles</em>, the 1948 film <em>Les parents terribles</em>, and the films <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, (1946) and <em>Orpheus</em> (1949).</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 James Fenimore Cooper, James Fenimore,Cooper,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-fenimore-cooper-autograph-letter-signed-libel-lawsuit/,Autograph Letter Signed Discussing Libel Lawsuit,"  <p>An important autograph letter signed by American author James Fenimore Cooper in which the writer discusses a very public libel lawsuit he instigated against various newspaper editors who wrote unfavorable reviews of his work, including Horace Greeley, Park Benjamin, Elius Pellet, and Thurlow Weed.</p> <p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Born in New Jersey in 1789, James Fenimore Cooper was the son of Judge William Cooper, the founder of Cooperstown, New York.</span></p> <p>When Cooper set sail with his family for Europe in 1826, he was at the height of his reputation with critics and of popularity with his readers. His novels such as <em>The Spy, The Pioneers</em>, and <em>The Last of the Mohicans</em> were also selling so well that he could afford to travel and reside in Europe for the next several years. During that time, however, he published certain works that seemed to Americans to be unfairly critical of his homeland, so that when he arrived back in New York in 1833 he was already becoming regarded as an antidemocratic, pseudo-aristocratic scold.</p> <p>After returning home, Cooper repurchased the family estate, including land on Lake Otsego called Three Mile Point, which his father had allowed villagers to use as a picnic site. On July 22, 1837, Cooper placed a notice in the local paper forbidding further public use of the Point. That curtly worded notice became the source of eight years of controversy and litigation.</p> <p>Residents held a town meeting protesting Cooper's actions and drew up resolutions to remove Cooper's book from the local library. Elius Pellet, editor of the <em>Chanango [NY] Telegraph</em> chronicled the conflict that August. The article was republished in the Albany <em>Evening Journal</em> by Thurlow Weed, and in the <em>Otsego Republican</em> by Andrew Barber.</p> <p>Cooper demanded a retraction from Barber, and in September 1838 he sued Pellet and Barber for libel, the subject of this letter. That suit, for replication of libelous materials, was the first to come to trial in the Fonda, New York, courthouse in May 1839, the month Cooper wrote the letter. The judge directed a verdict of $400 in favor of Cooper (about $10,000 adjusted for inflation), a judgment that was upheld on appeal. In March 1841, Cooper had authorities seize Barber's press and types to settle the award, bankrupting the editor.</p> <p>This letter, written to New York Congressman Daniel Dewey Barnard, reads:</p> <blockquote style=""margin: 0px 0px 0px 40px; border: none; padding: 0px""><p><em>Otsego Hall, Cooperstown, May 22nd, 1839</em></p><p><em>My Dear Sir,</em></p><p><em>It is a rule of law that a party cannot impeach his own witnesses, else would I call in question, the accuracy of Stevenson's testimony. The dear old fellow's eyes are bad, and he has mistaken a figure. I do not know what to think of the delay in the arrival of the letter, however, which has a suspicious appearance. The most disgraceful means were adopted to obtain a verdict, agents having been employed, as we have been told, to talk against me out of doors. As everything gets by action and reaction, I get the benefit of the last. On the trial, the defense set up was a pretense that Mr. Barber was vindicating me against the libel of the Chenango man. This ruse, with the fact that the libel was copied, that another suit was pending, and that I did not press for damages, probably reduced the verdict one half. As it was, all the intelligent part of the jury were for ____. I prefer the verdict as it is ($400), however, having Weed and the other man in view the change in opinion at Fonda [NY] was so great, that farmers came up and spoke to me, utter strangers, confessing that they have been prejudiced by the libel, and expressing their sense of the wrong that have been done. Here, the fox is utterly disconcerted, lying, wriggling and changing ground as usual.</em></p><p><em>A history ought to be a matter of fact, though, like most men, it is seldom what it ought to be. I aimed at truth in mine, and I believe I am nearer to it, than most historians, though I fear some mistakes must exist. At all events, I knew too much to swallow all the stuff that has been in circulation, and I have purified the accounts of the battles, from a vast deal of exaggerated nonsense. The story tells well enough, in its simple dress, and in that I have endeavored to place it before the world. Whether the false taste of this country will relish this course, I do not know, I have a good deal distrusted the result, there is such a strong love for hyperbole in the American character. It is by no means improbable, the public will think that the historian of the Navy ought to be on stilts, but I hold myself responsible for no man's opinions but my own. I have not yet heard how the book is liked.</em></p><p><em>I am much obliged to you and Stevenson and the others who intended coming to the rescue, and my present object is to say so.

Since Sean Connery uttered those immortal words in 1962, the most dashing secret agent in the history of cinema has been charming and thrilling audiences worldwide. This impeccably British character created by author Ian Fleming has starred in 23 EON produced films, played by 6 different actors over five decades. To celebrate 50 years of this innovative franchise, EON Productions opened their archives of photos, designs, storyboards, and production materials to editor Paul Duncan, who spent two years researching over one million images and 100 filing cabinets of documentation. The result is the most complete account of the making of the series, covering every James Bond film ever made, beginning with <em>Dr. No</em> (1962) and ending with <em>Skyfall</em> (2012), including the spoof <em>Casino Royale</em> (1967) and <em>Never Say Never Again</em> (1983).</p> <p>The stunning imagery is accompanied by an oral history recounted by over 150 cast and crew members, relating the true inside story of how the Bond films were made. Containing previously unpublished photography and artwork, as well as production memos from filming, this book is a comprehensive tribute to the legend of James Bond.</p> <p>Attached at the left, just beneath our Item Number, is a PDF you can download more fully describing the James Bond Archives Project and these fabulous books, celebrating the 50 years 007 has been entertaining fans worldwide. </p> <p><strong>About the editor</strong><br/>Paul Duncan has edited 50 film books for TASCHEN, including the award-winning The Ingmar Bergman Archives and The Pedro AlmodÃ³var Archives. He also authored Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick in TASCHEN's Film series.</p> <p><strong>About Ken Adam's Goldfinger  Art Print</strong><br/>Ken Adam's brilliant set drawings for the Bond series are legendary, and his design for 1964's <em>Goldfinger</em> was truly inspired. Replacing a low-tech circular saw in Goldfinger's Swiss facility, the industrial laser emits an extraordinary light not to be found in Nature. It can cut though solid metal, making it an ideal choice to cleave gold panels into more usable configurations for Goldfinger's operations. Those who have seen the film are well familiar with Goldfinger's nefarious use of the laser on Mr. Bond as he was restrained on the saw table, the laser advancing slowly...</p> <p align=""center""><img alt=""Actual Goldfinger Set Designed by Ken Adam"" height=""235"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/0C8D6FDA-1517-6111-2816A8C55E60F968.png"" title=""Actual Goldfinger Set Designed by Ken Adam"" width=""411""/> <br/><em>Actual live Goldfinger set designed by the legendary Ken Adam.</em></p> <p>James Bond films Â© 1962-2012 Danjaq, LLC and United Artists Corporation.

Being diehard James Bond fans from childhood, our interest was piqued when we had an opportunity to acquire the most sought-after items from any popular film: actual props<style type=""text/css"">font.f1 { font: 12px Georgia;</style><font class=""f1"" size=""3"">â</font>in this case, a <em>Casino Royale</em>-branded black and red <strong>$100,000 poker chip</strong> and black-backed <strong>playing card (the Nine of Hearts)</strong><font class=""f1"" size=""3"">â</font>used in the famous tournament scene with Le Chiffre on the set of Daniel Craig's breakout 007 film, <em>Casino Royale</em>. A numbered and signed Certificate of Authenticity with registration hologram is included, along with a <strong>stunning color photograph of the strapping Daniel Craig emerging from the sea, signed by him</strong> at the Dorchester Hotel in London on September 28, 2006 (COA included for this as well). The ensemble has been <strong>professionally framed</strong> in a movie-set motif.</p>   <p>Cartamundi, a Belgian company specializing in the production and sale of quality playing cards, was the exclusive supplier of playing cards and poker chips used in <em>Casino Royale</em>. Cartamundi was commissioned by EON Productions to design and produce the casino chips and cards for the Bond film, in collaboration with art director Simon Lamont, and ours were acquired from the prop masters on the <em>Casino Royale</em> sound stage in 2006. These are <em>not</em> reproductions, they are two of the actual props.<style type=""text/css"">font.f1 { font: 12px Georgia; }</style></p>   <p>For three key scenes in <em>Casino Royale</em>, including the final poker tournament scene at the casino in Montenegro, Cartamundi produced three different card decks and chips, manufactured in their Turnhout factory near Antwerp. Cartamundi worked in close collaboration with the producer's design department to decide on the look and style of these decks and chips, so that they would fit in with the overall style of the movie as a whole. For the other scenes involving playing cards and chips, Cartamundi supplied several sets from its existing collection.</p>   <p>This screen-used prop card, a Nine of Hearts, measures the same as a standard playing card (approximately 3.5"" x 2.5""); the black/red $100,000 chip measures approximately 1.5"" diameter. Each of these screen-used props is mounted inside an acid-freeÂ Plexiglas case on prop metal movie reels attached to the frame atop a piece of green card table felt. Each of the cases can easily be opened if youÂ wish without damage to the props, allowing view of both front and backs.</p> <p>Also included in this lot are an <strong>original filming Call Sheet and other materials</strong> that were only given out cast and crewmembers working on the set or on location of <em>Casino Royale</em>. This is not a copy, but an actual original Call Sheet obtained from a crew member working on the film, for shooting dated March 1, 2006 in the Bahamas; it includes details on where they're shooting, what scenes they're filming, times and locations, phone numbers of the crew, what props and costumes were needed for the scenes, and other relevant details for the day.

As a young boy, Cropsey had recurring periods of poor health. While absent from school, Cropsey taught himself to draw. His early drawings included architectural sketches and landscapes drawn on notepads and in the margins of his schoolbooks. After studying architecture for five years, he turned his attention to landscape painting, under the instruction of Edward Maury. He visited England, France, Switzerland, and Italy in 1847, went abroad again in 1855, and resided seven years in London, sending his pictures to the Royal Academy and to the International exhibition of 1862.  </p>   <p>After his return home in 1863, he opened a studio in New York, where he resided until 1885, when he removed to Hastings-on-Hudson.</p>   <p>Trained as an architect, he set up his own office in 1843. Cropsey studied watercolor and life drawing at the National Academy of Design and first exhibited there in 1844. A year later he was elected an associate member and turned exclusively to landscape painting in the 1840s, shortly after he was featured in an exhibition entitled ""Italian Compositions.""</p>   <p>Cropsey married Maria Cooley in May 1847, traveled in Europe from 1847-1849, was elected a full member of the Academy in 1851, and lived in England 1856-1863. During this time he specialized in autumnal landscape paintings of the northeastern United States, often idealized and with vivid colors. One such painting is ""The Valley of the Wyoming"" set in eastern Pennsylvania. The name of this valley was given to the western state of Wyoming.</p>   <p>Cropsey's interest in architecture continued throughout his life and was a strong influence in his painting, most evident in his precise arrangement and outline of forms. But Cropsey was best known for his lavish use of color and, as a first-generation member from the Hudson River School, painted autumn landscapes that startled viewers with their boldness and brilliance. As an artist, he believed landscapes were the highest art form and that nature was a direct manifestation of God. He also felt a patriotic affiliation with nature and saw his paintings as depicting the rugged and unspoiled qualities of America.</p> <p>Some of his works include ""Jedburgh Abbey""; ""Pontaine Marshes"" (1847); ""Backwoods of America"" (1857); ""Richmond Hill"" (1862); ""Greenwood Lake"" (1870); ""Lake Nemi in Italy"" (1879); ""Old Church at Arreton, Isle of Wight"" (1880); ""Ramapo Valley"" (1881); ""Autumn on the Hudson"" (1882): ""Wawayanda Valley"" (1883); ""Spring-time in England"" (1884); ""October in Ramapo Valley"" (1885); ""Autumn on Lake George,"" and ""A Showery Day"" (1886).</p>   <p>Jasper Cropsey died in anonymity but was rediscovered by galleries and collectors in the 1960s. Today, Cropsey's paintings are found in most major American museums, including the National Gallery of Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Timken Museum of Art in San Diego, the Honolulu Academy of Arts, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Denver Art Museum, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Works by Cropsey also hang in the White House.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Have a good trip if I do not see you before you leave, I would go over there, tell him and kiss everyone for me. </em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Eug. Delacroix</em></strong> </p></blockquote> <p><strong>FERDINAND VICTOR EUGÃNE DELACROIX</strong> (1798-1863) was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of color profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Sir Walter Scott, and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.</p> At a sale of his work in 1864, 9,140 works were attributed to Delacroix, including 853 paintings, 1,525 pastels and water colors, 6,629 drawings, 109 lithographs, and over 60 sketch books. The number and quality of the drawings, whether done for constructive purposes or to capture a spontaneous movement, underscored his explanation, ""Colour always occupies me, but drawing preoccupies me.""   <p>Delacroix produced several fine self-portraits, and a number of memorable portraits which seem to have been done purely for pleasure, among which were the portrait of fellow artist Baron Schwiter, an inspired small oil of the violinist NicolÃ² Paganini, and a double portrait of his friends, the composer FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin and writer George Sand; the painting was cut after his death, but the individual portraits survive.</p>   <p>On occasion Delacroix painted pure landscapes (The Sea at Dieppe, 1852) and still-lifes (Still Life with Lobsters, 1826-7), both of which feature the virtuoso execution of his figure-based works. He is also well known for his Journals, in which he gave eloquent expression to his thoughts on art and contemporary life. His works grace the walls of the Louvre, the Palace of Versailles, and the Hotel de Ville of Paris.</p> <p>Â <img alt=""Eugene Delacroix"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_C157C4A8-3048-C0CE-556A0EE08F591978.jpg"" title=""Eugene Delacroix"" width=""264""/><br/>Â  <em>Self portrait, 1837</em></p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Inscribed to his friend, the artist Roberto Domingo y FallolaâSpain's most famous painter of bullfights, and whose painting illustrates the cover of Hemingway's book  <em>Death in the Afternoon</em> âthe inscription reads: <blockquote><p><em>Pamplona<br/>Dear: Roberto / [Retreat?]<br/></em><em>You Papa<br/></em><em>Ernest Hemingway â47</em></p></blockquote> <p>Accompanied by letter of provenance establishing authenticity. This photograph is also featured on the official <a href=""http://robertodomingo.com/signed-photo-by-ernest-hemingway-1947/"" target=""_blank"">Roberto Domingo website</a>. Also shown in images (though not included) is a postcard that sold elsewhere, depicting Hemingway's cursive for ""Roberto"" and ""you papa"" in nearly identical form, provided as an exemplar helping to establish an otherwise difficult interpretation of his writing.</p> <p>Though it is unknown whether he was in Pamplona in 1947, that year was a significant one in the life of Ernest  Hemingway. In a small ceremony in June 1947, at the U.S. embassy in  Cuba, Hemingway was awarded a Bronze Star for his service as a war  correspondent for having circulated ""freely under fire in combat areas  in order to obtain an accurate picture of conditions. Through his talent  of expression, Mr. Hemingway enabled readers to obtain a vivid picture  of the difficulties and triumphs of the front-line soldier and his  organization in combat."" </p> <p>Hemingway became a bullfighting aficionado after seeing the Pamplona fiesta in the 1920s, which he wrote about in <em>The Sun Also Rises</em>. In another book, <em>Death in the Afternoon</em>, Hemingway explored the metaphysics of bullfightingâthe ritualized, almost religious practiceâthat he considered analogous to the writer's search for meaning and the essence of life. In bullfighting, he found the elemental nature of life and death.</p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""text-align: center""><img height=""380"" src=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/79D0BFA2-1517-6111-28EF67B72E60D1A3.png"" width=""290""/></p> <p><em><br/>Death in the Afternoon</em> was published by Scribner's in September 1932. As eloquently described by Miriam B. Mandel in her book <em>A Companion to Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon</em> (Camden House, 2004):</p> <blockquote><p>""<strong>The most arresting feature of the dust jacket is the painting by Roberto Domingo</strong> (1883-1956). Under the word ""Toros"", a powerful looking bull is pursuing a banderillero who trails a swirling cape of yellow and magenta, as he leaps over the barerra into the confetti-colored crowd. So close is the man's escape that he seems to be helped over the fence by the bulls approaching horns. The man, however, is not the protagonist of the scene. The center of attention is the charging bullâa splendid animal, with a dappled gray body and a handsome black head outlined against the red barrera. There is power in the broad back and in the hump of muscle that surges up from behind his horns, there is speed in the splayed legs and sinuous line of the spine from neck to tail, and danger in the solid curves of the sharp horns.""</p></blockquote> <p><em>Toros</em> (1923) is an oil painting, one of 18 painted by Domingo between 1915 and 1942, to advertise bullfight festivals in Valencia. The original painting was acquired personally by Hemingway, and still dominates the parlor of his <em>Finca Vigia</em> home in San Francisco de Paula, Cuba (now a museum).</p> <p>Â </p> <p style=""text-align: center""><img height=""362"" src=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/79C4E6CB-1517-6111-28056463722BED9B.png"" width=""500""/></p> <p><br/>Any discussion concerning bullfighting would be incomplete without some mention of the controversy surrounding it. To that end Hemingway commented, ""Anything capable of arousing passion in its favor will surely raise as much passion against it.""</p> <p>As an aside, ""Death in the Afternoon"" also refers to a cocktail invented by Hemingway: ""Pour one jigger absinthe into a Champagne glass. Add iced Champagne until it attains the proper opalescent milkiness. Drink three to five of these slowly. Note: After six of these cocktails The Sun Also Rises.""</p>  ",1947,4500,0,FALSE,3519,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/E8DC8918-1517-6111-28EC45B2C5FD6D3E.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/73F549FA-1517-6111-28A1288562BCB50A.jpg",Roberto Domingo

Wilde lived the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to England in late 1898. Douglas published several volumes of poetry, two books about his relationship with Wilde, and an autobiography.</p>   <p>Douglas in any form is quite rare, and with its association to Bosie's friend the literary critic Philip Page, makes this fine letter a perfect collectible for fans of Oscar Wilde.</p>   <p>Accompanied by adjoining cut sections of an aged vintage newspaper clipping from The (London) Daily Mail dated July 4, 1941, of the published poem ""Winston Churchill"" by Lord Alfred Douglas, with notations in green ink beneath reading ""P Page, affection, reconciliation.""

Signed by Frank Harris on first free end paper of Volume 1. Published by Author as Stated, New York, 1918. Near fine/No Jacket as issued. First Edition. Signed by Author. 8vo - over 7 3/4 "" - 9 3/4 "" tall. Very clean ink signature by Frank Harris on front end paper, adjacent to previous owner's bookplate. A very handsome two-volume set bound in green cloth covers with bright, blind-stamped gilt letters on covers. 612 pages plus introduction by George Bernard Shaw. Edges are remarkably fresh, not rubbed at all. Spines are firm and intact; though sun-faded they are still readable. Otherwise a tight, clean, complete copy with crisp and clean pages.</p> <p>Frank Harris' well-regarded 1918 biography of Oscar Wilde cannot be read as a simple historical document. Harris frequently invents or embroiders, recasting conversations so that his part in them became more central, placing himself at events where he was not in fact present, and even recounting incidents that never happened at all. However, it would not be fair to discount it entirely. At the time it was written Wilde was regarded as a pariah, yet Harris never swerved from his view that Wilde's treatment by the public, press and the judiciary had been a monstrous injustice.   </p> <p>The undoubted friendship between Oscar Wilde and Frank Harris is one of the stranger aspects of Harris' life. They were so unlike: Wilde the wit and aesthete, the darling of fashionable London, Harris playing the loud American, lecturing all within earshot about whatever they would least like to hear. And the fact they were both great talkers would, one might suppose, have led rather to rivalry than friendship. But as outsiders, exiles, perhaps there was a deeper common bond. In both, too, there was an idealistic streak, in Oscar's case it was beauty that he saw as the key to life, while Harris was an atheistic humanist who yet loved Jesus; if they failed to live up to their ideals then is that not the tragedy of us all?</p>   <p>In the end, Harris was generous to Wilde both in life and to his memory. He did not paint Wilde as a heroic figure, but Wilde was only intermittently heroic. If he did not convey much of Wilde's wit, that is documented well enough elsewhere, in Wilde's own works and the oft-told anecdotes of others.</p>   <p><em><strong>In Frank Harris's own words:</strong></em></p> <blockquote><p>""There are special reasons...why I should handle this story. Oscar Wilde was a friend of mine for many years: I could not help prizing him to the very end: he was always to me a charming, soul-animating influence. He was dreadfully punished by men utterly his inferiors: ruined, outlawed, persecuted till Death itself came as a deliverance. His sentence impeaches his judges. The whole story is charged with tragic pathos and unforgettable lessons. I have waited for more than ten years hoping that some one would write about him in this spirit and leave me free to do other things, but nothing such as I propose has yet appeared.""</p></blockquote> <p>Interestingly, Lord Alfred Douglas (""Bosie"", as Wilde called him) refuted many of the contentions in Harris's book in a letter dated December 27, 1929, which was later sold at auction by Sotheby's. Douglas writes:</p> <blockquote><p>""...I do not wish to add anything to what I have already said...because the complete <em>malentendu</em> between us is so great that the only thing to remove it is for you to read my book...Harris's book is a tissue of the most malicious &amp; cunningly devised lies ever invented by a malignant man (or rather two men for Ross helped him to distort the story)...I denied the immoral relations...simply because the conventions of English Society demanded it; and because I was thinking of the feelings of my mother my wife &amp; my son. I was told that if I admitted the truth I would be for ever ruined &amp; ostracised...In my present book I have admitted everything...the truth of my story...is now accepted by everyone, even by my enemies...I think you might search the annals of England in vain to find anyone who has <em>ever</em> admitted this particular vice before I did it myself in my Autobiography. As it happens it has done me no harm at all socially...""</p></blockquote>  ",1918,1200,0,FALSE,3406,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F60EC9E7-1517-6111-28C06883A87E7F16.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F612F2D0-1517-6111-286548400050250D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F61385C9-1517-6111-28510BE12F0E4289.jpg",
 Alfred Douglas, Alfred,Douglas,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/oscar-wilde-de-profundis-facsimile-numbered-limited-edition/,De Profundis Numbered Limited Edition,"  <p><strong>An extraordinary limited edition facsimile of the original manuscript of Oscar Wilde's <em>De Profundis</em>âa long, harrowing letter written to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, whose dysfunctional relationship with his father Wilde blamed for his trial and imprisonment from 1895-97. Hand-numbered 279 of an edition of 495 published on the centenary of the death of Oscar Wilde by his grandson, Merlin Holland.<br/></strong></p> <p>""<strong>De Profundis</strong>"" is Latin for ""from the depths""; it comes from the first line of Psalm 130 of the penitential Psalms: <em>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.</em> The writer E. V. Lucas (1868 - 1938) claimed to have suggested the title; Wilde had suggested ""Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis,"" meaning <em>Letter: In Prison and in Chains</em>.</p> <p>During Wilde's incarceration in Reading Gaol, warden Major James Nelson allowed Wilde greater access to books and paper than he had under previous wardens; Wilde would later call Nelson ""the most Christlike man I ever met."" Wilde could not bring himself to write a play under these conditions; instead he concentrated on the more typical prison genre of the letter, and worked on it between December 1896 and March 1897.</p> <p>As Wilde's biographer Richard Ellmann remarked, the ""most important thing about <em>De Profundis</em> is that it is a love letter;"" despite its occasional arrogance and understandable lapses in structure, ""one of the greatest, and the longest, ever written."" It could be seen as a dramatic monologue from Wilde to Douglasâa long, public address in which Douglas's responses are assumed.</p> <p>As an autobiographical attempt to understand the nature of his own life and work, <em>De Profundis</em> also reflects brilliantly on art, love, forgiveness, the significance of Christ, and Wilde's own character and failings. Some times it mimics the humility of Christ; at others it returns to an older arrogance:</p> <blockquote><p> <em>""I was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age. I had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood, and had forced my age to realise it afterwards [...]""</em></p></blockquote> <p>Throughout, we see Wilde's gift for a pithy, insightful statement, but sobered by suffering:</p> <blockquote><p><em>    ""Most people live for love and admiration. But it is by love and admiration that we should live.""</em></p></blockquote> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text is often savagely critical of Alfred Douglas, and accordingly, Wilde's executor Robert Ross and others feared being sued for libel if they published it in its entirety. The edition published in 1905 removed all reference to Douglas. In 1909, Ross gave this manuscript to the British Library (then the British Museum) on the condition that it was not made public for fifty years. In 1913, however, it was read in from as part of a libel case Douglas had brought against the writer Arthur Ransome, who had just published <em>Oscar Wilde: a Critical Study</em>. </p> <p>After Douglas's death Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland (1886-1967) published the full text of <em>De Profundis</em> (1949) from a transcript copy, but when Rupert Hart-Davis compared this version with the British Museum/British Library manuscript, he spotted inaccuracies and published a full version in 1962.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>[Portions of text Â© British Library Board as available under a Creative Commons Attribution License.]</p>  ",2000,499,0,FALSE,3789,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D1ECB8C9-1517-6111-284B316B21B7452D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D1EECB3E-1517-6111-28779280546CFB43.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D1EF56C5-1517-6111-286260A294FEFBD1.jpg",Alfred Douglas

Original grey boards with tan spine. Small portions of backstrip missing at top (see photos). Inscribed to ""Philip Page from his friend Alfred Douglas 1931"" in ink, on first front free endpaper. Douglas pans the ""Art for Art's Sake"" and anti-formal heresies, of which he names Oscar Wilde and Walt Whitman, respectively, as representatives. Dozens of Douglas' own poems, with the first, ""Apologia"", being in repudiation of some of his earlier work. 226 pp. </p> <p>This scarce book of his own poetry is signed by Lord Alfred Douglas, the intimate companion and lover of the writer Oscar Wilde. It is inscribed to literary critic Philip Page and comes to us from the estate of American actress Clare Boothe Luce, who was a close friend of Page. </p> <h3><strong>About Alfred Douglas</strong></h3>   <p>LORD ALFRED BRUCE DOUGLAS (1870-1945), was a British writer who first came to prominence in the 1890s as the young intimate companion of Oscar Wilde. After Douglas' father, the 9th Marquess of Queensbury, publicly accused Wilde of sodomy, Wilde filed the libel lawsuit that led to his own conviction and two-year prison term for indulging in ""the love that dare not speak its name.""</p>   <p>During the later part of 1897, Wilde and Douglas lived together near Naples, but for financial and other reasons, they separated. Wilde lived the remainder of his life primarily in Paris, and Douglas returned to England in late 1898. Douglas published several volumes of poetry, two books about his relationship with Wilde, and an autobiography.</p>   <p>Douglas in any form is quite rare, and with its association to Bosie's friend the literary critic Philip Page, makes this fine letter a perfect collectible for fans of Oscar Wilde.</p>   <p>Accompanied by adjoining cut sections of an aged vintage newspaper clipping from The (London) Daily Mail dated July 4, 1941, of the published poem ""Winston Churchill"" by Lord Alfred Douglas, with notations in green ink beneath reading ""P Page, affection, reconciliation.""

The hero, Etienne Gerard, is a Hussar in the French Army during the Napoleonic Wars. Gerard's most notable attribute is his vanityâhe is utterly convinced that he is the bravest soldier, greatest swordsman, accomplished horseman and gallant lover in all France. Gerard is not entirely wrong since he displays notable bravery on many occasions, but his self-satisfaction undercuts this quite often. Obsessed with honour and glory, he is always ready with a stirring speech or a gallant remark to a lady.</p> <p>Conan Doyle, in making his hero a vain, and often rather uncomprehending Frenchman, was able to satirize both the stereotypical English view of the French, andâby presenting them from Gerard's baffled point of viewâEnglish manners and attitudes.</p>  ",1903,400,0,FALSE,3595,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/81294A6C-1517-6111-28DE295558377832.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8129D660-1517-6111-28684FFBFEEE512D.png",
 Arthur Conan Doyle, Arthur Conan,Doyle,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/arthur-conan-doyle-autograph-signature/,Signature,"  <p><strong>Clear, bold signature likely cut from the end page of a book.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE</strong> (1859-1930) was a British author most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock Holmes, which are generally considered a major innovation in the field of crime fiction, and for the adventures of Professor Challenger. He was a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories, historical novels, plays and romances, poetry, and non-fiction.</p> <p> Doyle's first historical novel was published in 1889. He was living in London in 1890 and practicing as an occultist. By 1891, he had become a full time writer. In 1892, the first collection of Sherlock Holmes stories was published. A total of five collections of Holmes stories have been published. </p> <p> Charles Altamont Doyle, Arthur's father, died in 1893 in the nursing home he had been committed to in 1879. In the same year as his father's death, Doyle decided to kill off Sherlock Holmes. Doyle was tired of writing short stories. He wanted to be remembered for his historical novels rather than his detective. So, in 1894, Arthur Conan Doyle officially killed off Sherlock Holmes, one of the greatest literary detectives ever to live. </p> <p> During the South African War, from 1899-1902, Doyle served as senior physician at a field hospital for a short time. In 1900, he ran unsuccessfully for Parliament for the first time. He was knighted in 1902, making him Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In 1903, at the request of his government and by public demand, Sherlock Holmes was resurrected for a story involving a secret mission for the government during a time of war. </p> <p> Doyle's last Sherlock Holmes story was published in 1917. By 1920, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was one of the highest paid writers in the world. After the death of his son in World War One, Doyle immersed himself in spiritual studies. Spiritualism became his religion. In 1921, Arthur's mother, Mary Foley Doyle, passed away. Eight years later, Doyle suffered from a heart attack. On July 7, 1930, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle died from heart disease at his home in Windlesham, Sussex, England. He was originally buried in the garden of his home, but was later moved to the village churchyard at Minstead. </p> <p><img alt=""Arthur Conan Doyle"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_FCAE25EF-3048-C0CE-554CA8B21C584849.jpg"" title=""Arthur Conan Doyle"" width=""268""/></p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Light soiling inside front and rear covers at spine, otherwise no markings or bookplates.</p> <p>Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning DBE (1907-1989) was a British author and playwright. Although classed as a romantic novelist, her stories seldom feature a conventional happy ending, and have been described as ""moody and resonant,"" with overtones of the paranormal. Many have been successfully adapted into films, including this novel, <em>Rebecca</em>, and the short story <em>The Birds</em>, which served as the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1963 classic film of the same name starring Tippi Hedren and Rod Taylor.</p> <p><em>Rebecca</em>, however, was du Maurier's most important book, having also been made into a classic film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1940, starring Joan Fontaine, Laurence Oliver, George Sanders, and Judith Anderson. It was actually Hitchcock's first American project, which won two Academy Awards, including Best Picture, out of a total of 11 nominations.

He is best known for <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, <em>The Three Musketeers</em>, and <em>The Man in the Iron Mask</em>. He also wrote plays and magazine articles and was a prolific correspondent. Dumas made extensive use of the aid of numerous assistants and collaborators, of which Auguste Maquet was the best known. It was Maquet who outlined the plot of <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em> and made substantial contributions to <em>The Three Musketeers</em> and its sequels, as well as several of Dumas's other novels. When working together, Maquet proposed plots and wrote drafts, while Dumas added the details, dialogues, and the final chapters.</p>   <p>His writing earned him a great deal of money, but Dumas was frequently broke or in debt as a result of spending lavishly on women and high living. The large and costly ChÃ¢teau de Monte-Cristo that he built was often filled with strangers and acquaintances who took advantage of his generosity.</p>   <p>Dumas' paternal grandparents were a French nobleman and an Afro-Caribbean former slave. Consequently, despite his success and aristocratic connections, his being of mixed-race would affect him all his life. It is attributed to him a personal quote to someone who insulted him about his mixed-race background: <em>""It is true. My father was a mulatto, my grandmother was a negress, and my great-grandparents were monkeys. In short, sir, my pedigree begins where yours ends.""</em></p>   <p>Â </p>   <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Replacing a low-tech circular saw in Goldfinger's Swiss facility, the industrial laser emits an extraordinary light not to be found in Nature. It can cut though solid metal, making it an ideal choice to cleave gold panels into more usable configurations for Goldfinger's operations. Those who have seen the film are well familiar with Goldfinger's nefarious use of the laser on Mr. Bond as he was restrained on the saw table, the laser advancing slowly...</p> <p align=""center""><img alt=""Actual Goldfinger Set Designed by Ken Adam"" height=""235"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/0C8D6FDA-1517-6111-2816A8C55E60F968.png"" title=""Actual Goldfinger Set Designed by Ken Adam"" width=""411""/> <br/><em>Actual live Goldfinger set designed by the legendary Ken Adam.</em></p> <p>James Bond films Â© 1962-2012 Danjaq, LLC and United Artists Corporation.

His teachings directly influenced the growing New Thought movement of the mid 1800s.</p>   <p><strong></strong>Emerson gradually moved away from the religious and social beliefs of his contemporaries, formulating and expressing the philosophy of Transcendentalism in his 1836 essay, <em>Nature</em>. As a result of this ground breaking work he gave a speech entitled <em>The American Scholar</em> in 1837, which Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. considered to be America's ""Intellectual Declaration of Independence"". Emerson once said ""Make the most of yourself, for that is all there is of you.""</p>   <p>Considered one of the great orators of the time, Emerson's enthusiasm and respect for his audience enraptured crowds. His support for abolitionism late in life created controversy, and at times he was subject to abuse from crowds while speaking on the topic, however this was not always the case. When asked to sum up his work, he said his central doctrine was ""the infinitude of the private man.""</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Signed ""Ian Fleming"" in his characteristic blue ballpoint on the first inside teaser page. First printing April 1963 by Signet Books. Light rubbing to spine and cover edges, with minor handling wear and a small fold on lower right corner on cover, otherwise very good; appears tight and unread, especially so given its age. Provenance from the estate of English footballer and cricketer Norman Lawson.</p> <p><strong>IAN FLEMING</strong> (1908-1964) was a British author, journalist and Second World War Navy Commander. Fleming is best remembered for creating the character of James Bond and chronicling his adventures in twelve novels and nine short stories. Additionally, Fleming wrote the children's story <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em> and two non-fiction books.</p>   <p><em>The Spy Who Loved Me</em> (1962) stylistically departs from other books in the Bond series as it is written in the first person perspective of the (fictional) protagonist, Vivienne Michel, whom Fleming credits as co-author. It is the story of her life, up until when James Bond serendipitously rescues her from the wrong circumstance at the wrong place and time.</p>   <p>Authentically-signed books by Ian Fleming are very scarce, and are eagerly sought after by avid James Bond fans. The condition of this book is remarkable for its age. There is a horizontal crease on the top of the back, and a small fold on the corner on the front of the book. There are also slight creases on the front of the book. The fold continues for just a few pages. The quality of the signature is wonderful, though it is slightly fading. The binding is in very good shape. <strong>With provenance and Certificate of Authenticity from the Norman Lawson Estate.</strong></p> <p><strong>Norman Lawson</strong> (1936-2011) was an English football and cricket player. In football (soccer) Lawson played as a winger, spending his early career with Hednesford Town, Bury and Swansea Town. He later played for Watford, Kettering Town and Hereford United, before becoming player-manager of both Merthyr Tydfil and Ton Pentre. His later cricket career was spent playing for Swansea Civil Service, Sketty Church, AWCO and Sketty Quins clubs, while he was Captain of the Welsh over-50 team.</p> <p>In his youth, Ian Fleming was an extraordinary athlete during his years at Eton, playing both football and cricket, and were it not for the fact that, as Fleming biographer John Pearson put it, ""team games never suited his isolated spirit,"" might easily have take a different path in life.</p>  ",1963,1500,0,FALSE,3118,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/44DF750C-3048-C0CE-558FBF183FA4E55C.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/44E002ED-3048-C0CE-554F920CBD2CE31E.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/44E064EE-3048-C0CE-5506AF8A3FD6008D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/BEDA0CCC-1517-6111-28BD5A2FD7B8F6BD.jpg",

 Neil Gaiman, Neil,Gaiman,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/neil-gaiman-signed-broadside-eight-rules-for-writing/,"Signed Broadside ""Eight Rules of Writing""","  <p align=""center""><strong>Limited Edition Broadside<br/>Signed by Neil Gaiman &amp; George Walker<br/>""Eight Rules for Writing""</strong></p> <p>Known for his infinite attention-to-detail in his stories as well as any other undertaking, Neil Gaiman never disappoints. Here he offers up a limited edition broadside titled ""Eight Rules for Writing,"" printed in a strict edition of 251 copies (this being #34) on a Vandercook SP15 proof press. The paper is 10"" x 22"" Stonehenge Rising white 250gm with a deckle edge on the top and bottom edges. The inks used were Van Son and Hostmann &amp; Steinberg oil based and rubber based inks and overprint varnish. The typefaces were carved by hand out of birch faced plywood and battleship linoleum.</p> <p>""Battleship linoleum?"" It goes on.</p> <p>The artwork was created by engraving on the endgrain of maple wood and carving battleship linoleum that was mounted onto 3/4"" plywood. Five impressions (individual times the paper was hand fed through the press) were made for each color, accounting for over 1,500 impressions including proof and set-up sheets used in the registration process. Two tones of black were used in the printing of the ravens. The top ravens are in red black and the bottom ravens in charcoal black. The text color was hand mixed using a variety of inks including a silver-based letterpress ink.</p> <p>There are eight ravens pictured in the broadside. Six of them are in black and two are embossed into the paper making them almost invisible. This is intentional. Two of the qualities of good writing are almost always invisible. As Gaiman notes,<em> ""Just because we cannot name them doesn't mean they are not there working in the background."" </em>Brilliant.</p> <p>The raven as a symbol for the author and the task of writing extends beyond the obvious comparison to Poe and his poem of the same name. The raven's intelligence is possibly its most wondrous feature considering that these birds can be trained to speak. ""<em>Nevermore</em>"" was the ominous word spoken by the raven forever haunting Edgar Allan Poe.</p> <p>The raven is often heard to caw a sound that resembles ""cras"" The word cras is tomorrow in Latin and that is what most writers struggle withâputting off what they could do today until tomorrow. The raven is both a warning and an inspiration.</p> <p>The raven's symbolism also embodies wisdom and knowledge. All these things are useful to writers who are honing their craft. In Norse mythology the god Odin has two ravens, Huginn and Muninn, that serve as his eyes and ears. Huginn represents thought, while Muninn  symbolizes memoryâthey are constantly advising Odin and he heeds their advice. Both of the attributes of memory and thought are necessary for good writing. There are many more things that link the raven to writing, but part of the fun of the broadside is to leave some of the mystery for discovery by others.</p> <p><em>(With special thanks to Neil and his Biting Dog Press for the fanciful story, not to mention their spectacular craftsmanship on this limited edition broadside.)</em></p>  ",2014,sold,1,FALSE,3725,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9024E746-1517-6111-281B14EF978169ED.jpg,

 Keith Haring, Keith,Haring,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/keith-haring-signed-drawing-of-two-men-emerging-from-a-third/,Original Signed Drawing,"  <p><strong>Spectacular original, one-of-a-kind signed sketch by Keith Haring, one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Drawn in his spare but distinctive graffiti-inspired style, this marvelous piece depicts two men emerging from the midsection of a man looking down at himselfâperhaps contemplating alternate identities? </strong>That's the brilliance of Haring: his works are deliberately ""untitled,"" believing the artist's ideas are not fundamental to the meaning of the work. Rather, it is the observer who becomes an artist, in the sense that he or she must find his or her own unique way towards understanding. On green paper from an autograph album, measuring 3.5"" x 5"". </p> <p>From his origins as a cult street artist, Haring's designs would come to define the 1980s, appearing in such disparate venues as the Berlin Wall, Swatch watch designs, and Absolut vodka ad campaigns. His unique approach took everyday forms of visual representation and reimagined them into art that could belong as much to the street as in the finest museums. By the time of his early death at 31 from AIDS, his reputation was already well established, and his works are in high demand worldwide.</p> <p><strong>Keith Allen Haring</strong> (1958-1990) was an American artist and social activist whose work responded to the New York City street culture of the 1980s by expressing concepts of birth, death, sexuality, and war. Haring's work was often heavily political and his imagery has become a widely recognized visual language of the 20th century, and whose friendship with artist Andy Warhol would prove to be a decisive element in his eventual success.</p>  ",,1500,0,FALSE,3846,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/286AF183-1517-6111-28A9FFCA83719818.jpg,

Signed by Frank Harris on first free end paper of Volume 1. Published by Author as Stated, New York, 1918. Near fine/No Jacket as issued. First Edition. Signed by Author. 8vo - over 7 3/4 "" - 9 3/4 "" tall. Very clean ink signature by Frank Harris on front end paper, adjacent to previous owner's bookplate. A very handsome two-volume set bound in green cloth covers with bright, blind-stamped gilt letters on covers. 612 pages plus introduction by George Bernard Shaw. Edges are remarkably fresh, not rubbed at all. Spines are firm and intact; though sun-faded they are still readable. Otherwise a tight, clean, complete copy with crisp and clean pages.</p> <p>Frank Harris' well-regarded 1918 biography of Oscar Wilde cannot be read as a simple historical document. Harris frequently invents or embroiders, recasting conversations so that his part in them became more central, placing himself at events where he was not in fact present, and even recounting incidents that never happened at all. However, it would not be fair to discount it entirely. At the time it was written Wilde was regarded as a pariah, yet Harris never swerved from his view that Wilde's treatment by the public, press and the judiciary had been a monstrous injustice.   </p> <p>The undoubted friendship between Oscar Wilde and Frank Harris is one of the stranger aspects of Harris' life. They were so unlike: Wilde the wit and aesthete, the darling of fashionable London, Harris playing the loud American, lecturing all within earshot about whatever they would least like to hear. And the fact they were both great talkers would, one might suppose, have led rather to rivalry than friendship. But as outsiders, exiles, perhaps there was a deeper common bond. In both, too, there was an idealistic streak, in Oscar's case it was beauty that he saw as the key to life, while Harris was an atheistic humanist who yet loved Jesus; if they failed to live up to their ideals then is that not the tragedy of us all?</p>   <p>In the end, Harris was generous to Wilde both in life and to his memory. He did not paint Wilde as a heroic figure, but Wilde was only intermittently heroic. If he did not convey much of Wilde's wit, that is documented well enough elsewhere, in Wilde's own works and the oft-told anecdotes of others.</p>   <p><em><strong>In Frank Harris's own words:</strong></em></p> <blockquote><p>""There are special reasons...why I should handle this story. Oscar Wilde was a friend of mine for many years: I could not help prizing him to the very end: he was always to me a charming, soul-animating influence. He was dreadfully punished by men utterly his inferiors: ruined, outlawed, persecuted till Death itself came as a deliverance. His sentence impeaches his judges. The whole story is charged with tragic pathos and unforgettable lessons. I have waited for more than ten years hoping that some one would write about him in this spirit and leave me free to do other things, but nothing such as I propose has yet appeared.""</p></blockquote> <p>Interestingly, Lord Alfred Douglas (""Bosie"", as Wilde called him) refuted many of the contentions in Harris's book in a letter dated December 27, 1929, which was later sold at auction by Sotheby's. Douglas writes:</p> <blockquote><p>""...I do not wish to add anything to what I have already said...because the complete <em>malentendu</em> between us is so great that the only thing to remove it is for you to read my book...Harris's book is a tissue of the most malicious &amp; cunningly devised lies ever invented by a malignant man (or rather two men for Ross helped him to distort the story)...I denied the immoral relations...simply because the conventions of English Society demanded it; and because I was thinking of the feelings of my mother my wife &amp; my son. I was told that if I admitted the truth I would be for ever ruined &amp; ostracised...In my present book I have admitted everything...the truth of my story...is now accepted by everyone, even by my enemies...I think you might search the annals of England in vain to find anyone who has <em>ever</em> admitted this particular vice before I did it myself in my Autobiography. As it happens it has done me no harm at all socially...""</p></blockquote>  ",1918,1200,0,FALSE,3406,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F60EC9E7-1517-6111-28C06883A87E7F16.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F612F2D0-1517-6111-286548400050250D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F61385C9-1517-6111-28510BE12F0E4289.jpg",

Her motion picture debut was in <em>Battle of Hearts</em> (1916). She appeared in more than 120 movies over the following twenty-three years, usually portraying distinguished-looking society women.</p>   <p>As her movie career waned in the mid-1930s, Hopper looked for other sources of income. In 1937, she was offered the chance of a lifetime and embarked on a career doing something she was quite adept at: gossip. Her gossip column called ""<em>Hedda Hopper's Hollywood</em>"" debuted in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> on February 14, 1938. After years of struggling as an actress, she had finally found her niche. She christened the home she purchased in Beverly Hills ""The House That Fear Built."" She then had a notorious feud with the long-established <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/louella-parsons-autograph-note-signed-signature-mary-margaret-mcBride"">Louella Parsons</a>, who had been friendly to her in print and to whom she had sometimes passed information. Hopper and Parsons became archrivals competing fiercely, and often nastily, for the title ""Queen of Hollywood"", although those who knew both declared that Hopper was the more sadistic.</p>   <p>She was noted for her hats, considered her trademark, mostly because of her taste for large, flamboyant ones; and her hats were so famous that, in the 1946 movie, <em>Breakfast in Hollywood</em>, Del Porter, backed by Spike Jones and his City Slickers, even sang a novelty song entitled ""<em>A Hat for Hedda Hopper</em>"", to Hedda Hopper who was sitting in the audience wearing an extraordinary creation.</p>   <p>She was known for hobnobbing with the biggest names in the industry, for getting a ""scoop"" before almost anyone else most of the time, and for being vicious in dealing with those who displeased her, whether intentionally or not. The columnist J.J. Hunsecker, played by Burt Lancaster in the film <em>Sweet Smell of Success</em>, is said to have been inspired partly by Hopper.</p>   <p>Hopper courted controversy as well for ""naming names"" of suspected or alleged Communists during the Hollywood Blacklist. Her frequent attacks against Charlie Chaplin in the 1940s for his leftist politics and love life contributed to his departure from America in 1952. After publishing a blind item on Katharine Hepburn and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/spencer-tracy-autograph-signed-signature-san-francisco-mgm"">Spencer Tracy</a>'s relationship, Tracy confronted her at Ciro's and kicked her in the behind. A similar incident occurred when Hopper leaked info about the extramarital affair between Joseph Cotten and Deanna Durbin. She tried to ""out"" <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/cary-grant-signed-vintage-photo-autographed-inscribed-signature"">Cary Grant</a> and Randolph Scott as gay lovers, but Grant was too big a star even for her to touch. She also spread rumors that Michael Wilding and Stewart Granger had been intimate (Wilding later sued Hopper for libel and won). ZaSu Pitts compared Hopper to ""a ferret"", and pointed out that she should not have been surprised her (Hopper's) own movie career did not pan out. Joan Fontaine sent Hopper a skunk on Valentine's Day with a note reading ""I stink and so do you"".</p>   <p>Having spent years with her own programs on radio for various networks, on January 10, 1960, a TV special, <em>Hedda Hopper's Hollywood</em>, aired on NBC. Hosted by Hopper, guest interviews included an extremely eclectic mix of then-current and former stars: Lucille Ball (a longtime friend of Hopper), Francis X. Bushman, Liza Minnelli, John Cassavetes, Robert Cummings, Marion Davies (her last public appearance), Walt Disney, Janet Gaynor, Bob Hope, Hope Lange, Anthony Perkins, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart and Gloria Swanson.</p>   <p>Hopper also had several acting roles during the latter part of her career, including brief cameo appearances as herself in the movie <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) and <em>The Patsy</em> (1964), as well as episodes of <em>I Love Lucy</em> and <em>The Beverly Hillbillies</em>. Her autobiography, From <em>Under My Hat</em> (Doubleday, 1952) was followed by <em>The Whole Truth and Nothing But</em> (1962), also published by Doubleday.</p>   <p>Hopper remained active as a writer until her death, producing six daily columns and a Sunday column for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> syndicate, as well as writing countless articles for celebrity magazines such as <em>Photoplay</em>. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Hopper has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6313 1/2 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Gaudette. Measures 11.5"" x 8.25"". Slight water stain along bottom edge, partially affecting the signature, though it is still quite clear.</p> <p>Houdini, son of a Hungarian rabbi who had emigrated to Wisconsin, had an early affinity for conjuring and took the stage name Houdini, but his great success came from public performances in England and the Continent from 1895. It was as an escape artistâwith a decided talent for using the mediaâthat Houdini became celebrated; he appeared in several movies after World War I and eventually launched his own motion picture production company. While the company issued some $500,000 in capital stock, few original stock certificates are extant today.</p> <p>This certificate is printed in deep black and brown, with a fairly clear embossed ""Houdini Picture Corporation"" Seal impression at the lower left. The Houdini Picture Corporation was formed by Harry Houdini in 1920. He directed and produced only two movies: the first, ""The Man from Beyond"", was successful; the second, ""Haldane of the Secret Service"", proved a dismal failure. At that point, Houdini abruptly ended his film career. The Houdini Picture Corporation went out of business less than 6 years after its creation.</p>  ",1921,sold,1,FALSE,3596,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/DAE64493-1517-6111-28364A1424D5D660.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/DAE6B222-1517-6111-28DD979EC5F20A3F.png",

Houdini writes to Roger Barrett, the young son of his attorney and famed collector Oliver Barrett. In full:</p> <blockquote>""Does Roger know this trick / Take pack of cards turn up top card count up to thirteen viz the top card is a 9 add 4 moreâ / Keep on making packs counting to 13-(King is a pack in itself). / You will generally have a few cards left, but should it come out to an even count of 13 the result will be the same. / Ask someone to remove all but 3 packsâCollect these &amp; add any residue in making the packsâshall we call this the main pack. / Ask someone to turn up the top card of two of the remaining 3 packs-and add 10 to their additionâ(always 10 irrespective of the turn up) say a 5 and a queenâthat is 17 &amp; 10 is 27. Count 27 cards off the main pack and the card on the top of the remaining uncovered pack is the same as the number left in your hand."" <br/></blockquote> <p><strong>Oliver Barrett</strong> (mentioned in Houdini's 1924 book <em>Magician Among the Spirits</em> as having accompanied Houdini to a seance), was Houdini's long-time personal friend, attorney and fellow autograph collector. The famed <strong>Players Club</strong> is one of the most exclusive clubs in the world, designated a National Historic Landmark. It was founded in 1888 by the actor Edwin Booth with the intention of being a place for actors to mingle with those in other fields, ""men of theatre, fine arts and letters, journalism, and commerce."" Its famous members have included Ernest Hemingway, James Thurber, Mark Twain, Humphrey Bogart, President Grover Cleveland, Walter Cronkite, Henry James, Sydney Poitier, Cole Porter, and Cornelius Vanderbilt, among many others. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia we sell is unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Harry Houdini forever changed the world of magic and escapes, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest escapologists in history.</p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">As a child, Ehrich took several jobs, then became a champion cross country runner. He made his public dÃ©but as a 9-year-old trapeze artist, calling himself ""Ehrich, the prince of the air"". Weiss became a professional magician and began calling himself ""Harry Houdini"" because he was heavily influenced by the French magician Jean EugÃ¨ne Robert-Houdin, and his friend Jack Hayman told him that in French, adding an ""i"" to Houdin would mean ""like Houdin"" the great magician. In later life, Houdini would claim that the first part of his new name, Harry, was an homage to Harry Kellar, whom Houdini admired a great deal. However, it's more likely Harry derived naturally from his childhood nickname ""Ehriee"".<br/><br/>Initially, Houdini's magic career resulted in little success. He performed in dime museums and sideshows, and even doubled as ""the Wild Man"" at a circus. Houdini initially focused on traditional card tricks. At one point, he billed himself as the ""King of Cards"". But he soon began experimenting with escape acts. In 1893, while performing with his brother ""Dash"" at Coney Island as ""The Houdini Brothers"", Harry met fellow performer Wilhelmina Beatrice (Bess) Rahner, whom he married. Bess replaced Dash in the act, which became known as ""The Houdinis"". For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess would work as his stage assistant.<br/><br/>Harry Houdini's ""big break"" came in 1899 when he met manager Martin Beck in rural Woodstock, Illinois. Impressed by Houdini's handcuffs act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit. Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country. In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe, where he was a huge sensation.<br/><br/>From 1907 and throughout the 1910s, Houdini performed with great success in the United States. He would free himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and straitjackets, often while hanging from a rope in plain sight of street audiences. <br/><br/>Houdini explained some of his tricks in books written for the magic brotherhood throughout his career. In <em>Handcuff Secrets</em> (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings. Other times, he carried concealed lockpicks or keys, being able to regurgitate small keys at will. When tied down in ropes or straitjackets, he gained wiggle room by enlarging his shoulders and chest, moving his arms slightly away from his body, and then dislocating his shoulders. <br/><br/>Harry Houdini died of peritonitis secondary to a ruptured appendix. It has been speculated that Houdini was killed accidentally by a McGill University student, J. Gordon Whitehead, who delivered multiple blows to Houdini's abdomen (with permission) while he was in Montreal. These repetitive blows are thought to have been a stunt, in which Houdini displayed his dexterity. Houdini died of peritonitis from a ruptured appendix at 1:26 p.m. in Room 401 on October 31 (Halloween), 1926, at the age of 52.</p> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><img alt=""Harry Handcuff Houdini"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_57939921-1517-6111-287122F145D696C2.jpg"" title=""Harry Handcuff Houdini"" width=""214""/></p> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><em>Harry Houdini </em></p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All Vintage Memorabilia we sell is unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Accompanied by Letter of Authenticity by James Spence Authentication LLC.</p> <p><strong>JAMES BYRON DEAN</strong> (1931-1955) was a two-time Oscar-nominated American film actor. Dean's status as a cultural icon is best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, in which he starred as troubled stereotypical high school rebel Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his star power were as the awkward loner Cal Trask in <em>East of Eden</em>, and as the surly farmer Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>. His enduring fame and popularity rests on only three films, his entire starring output. His death at the young age of 24 helped guarantee a legendary status. He was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only person to have two posthumous acting nominations.</p>   <p>In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for an actor to play the role of ""Cal Trask"" in screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel <em>East of Eden</em>. The book dealt with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California in the mid-1800s through the 1910s. However, the film chose to deal predominantly with the character of Cal Trask, who is essentially the rebel son of a pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey), and estranged mother, whom Cal discovers is a brothel-keeping madam (Jo Van Fleet). Elia Kazan said of Cal before casting, ""I wanted a Brando for the role."" Osborn suggested to Kazan that he consider Dean for the part. After introducing Dean to Steinbeck, and gaining his enthusiastic approval, Kazan set about putting the wheels in motion to cast the relatively unknown young actor in the role. On March 8, 1954, Dean left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>. Both characters are rebel loners and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving parental guidance from a father figure.</p>   <p>Much of Dean's performance in the film is completely unscripted, such as his dance in the bean field and his curling up and pulling his arms inside of his shirt on top of the train during his ride home from meeting his mother. The most famous improvisation during the film was when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000 (which was in reparation for his father's business loss). Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and, crying, embraced him. This cut and Massey's shocked reaction were kept in the film by Kazan.</p>   <p>At the 1955 Academy Awards, he received a posthumous Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination for this role, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Many American teens at the time of Dean's major movies identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>: the typical teenager, caught where no one, not even his peers, can understand him.

According to Hunter in his 2005 autobiography <em>Tab Hunter Confidential</em>, ""I was with Dick [Clayton, his agent] one night when he had to deliver contracts to Jimmy on the set of <em>Rebel</em>...Â  Jimmy and I hung around outside while the crew prepped another setup. An enterprising studio publicity photographer saw us chatting and began snapping dozens of picturesâthe polar opposites of America's youth culture, captured together.""</p> <p><strong>TAB HUNTER</strong> (born July 11, 1931) is an American actor and singer, who has starred in over forty major motion pictures.<br/><br/>Born Arthur Gelien, he was signed to a contract at Warner Bros. and christened ""Tab Hunter"" by his first agent, Henry Willson. His good looks got him pegged as a screen idol (dubbed the ""Sigh Guy""). He landed a role in the film <em>Island of Desire</em> opposite Linda Darnell. However, it was his co-starring role as young Marine Danny in 1955's World War II drama <em>Battle Cry</em>, in which he has an affair with an older woman but ends up marrying the girl next door, that cemented his position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads. He went on to star in over 40 major Holywood films.<br/><br/>Hunter had a 1957 hit record with a cover of the song ""Young Love"", which was #1 on the charts for six weeks. He also had the hit ""Ninety-Nine Ways"", which peaked at #11 in the charts, and was actually his first single, before ""Young Love"". His success prompted Jack Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single, from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter, although his singing career foundered after a few more recordings.<br/><br/>Hunter's best role during this period was in the 1958 musical movie <em>Damn Yankees</em>, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington D.C's American League baseball club. The movie had originally been a Broadway show, and Hunter was the only one in the film version who hadn't appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book <em>The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant</em> by Douglass Wallop.<br/><br/>Hunter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6320 Hollywood Blvd.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In excellent condition with Brodart dust jacket protector; appears unread.</strong></p> <p><strong>Christopher Isherwood</strong> (1904-1986), Anglo-American novelist, was born in the ancestral seat of his family, Wybersley Hall, High Lane, in the north west of England. The son of landed gentry, his army officer father was killed in the First World War.</p>   <p>At school he met W. H. Auden who became his lifelong friend. Rejecting his upper-class background and attracted to boys, he moved to Berlin, the capital of the young Weimar Republic, drawn by its deserved reputation for sexual freedom. He worked as private tutor while writing the novel <em>Mr. Norris Changes Trains</em> and a series of short stories collected under the title <em>Goodbye to Berlin</em>. These provided the inspiration for the play <em>I Am a Camera</em> and subsequently the musical <em>Cabaret</em>. A memorial plaque to Isherwood has been erected on the house in SchÃ¶neberg, Berlin where he lived. In September 1931 the poet William Plomer introduced him to E.M. Forster; they became close and Forster served as a mentor to the young writer.</p>   <p>Auden and Isherwood travelled first to China in 1938, then emigrated to the United States in 1939. Isherwood settled in California where he embraced Hinduism. Together with Swami Prabhavananda he produced several Hindu scriptural translations, <em>Vedanta</em> essays, the biography <em>Ramakrishna and his Followers</em>, and novels, plays and screenplays, all imbued with themes and characters of Vedanta, karma, reincarnation and the Upanishadic quest.</p>   <p>Arriving in Hollywood in 1939, he first met Gerald Heard, the mystic-historian who founded his own monastery at Trabuco Canyon that was eventually gifted to the Vedanta Society. Through Heard, who was the first to discover Swami Prabhavananda and Vedanta, Isherwood joined an extraordinary band of mystic explorers that included Aldous Huxley, Bertrand Russell, Chris Wood, John Yale and J. Krishnamurti. Through Huxley, Isherwood befriended the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky.</p>   <p>Isherwood became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1946. From 1953 until his death, Isherwood lived with his partner, the portrait artist Don Bachardy. Isherwood died in Santa Monica, California.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Facsimile signature opposite copyright page.</p> <p>In 1976, Elton John's year-long world concert tour smashed attendance records from Earl's Court, London, to Madison Square Garden. Onstage, he was seen by millions; offstage, he lived in a private world known only to a few close friends. Now, with the help of gifted lyricist/poet Bernie Taupin and rock photographer David Nutter, Elton shares that very private world with the public, revealing for the first time an entire year of personal adventures and memories aboard his private plane, on the beaches of Barbados, at intimate backstage gatherings, and in quiet moments with friends (including some very famous faces).</p> <p>Never before has a rock performer authorized such a candid exploration of his private life; never before has the glitter - and lunacy - of the concert touring scene been recorded with such sensitive clarity.

Along with William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, he is amongst the best known of the writers (and friends) that comprised the Beat Generation, a term he coined for the disillusioned young intellectuals who thought that the American Dream had gone sour.</p>   <p>Kerouac's work was very popular, but received little critical acclaim during his lifetime. Today, he is considered an important and influential writer who inspired others, including Tom Robbins, Lester Bangs, Richard Brautigan, Ken Kesey, and writers of the New Journalism. Kerouac also influenced musicians such as The Beatles, Ben Gibbard, Bob Dylan, Tom Waits, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and Jim Morrison.

In As New, Unread condition, signed in blue Sharpie with provenance.</strong> A summary of this thriller, hailed as one of King's finest works:</p> <blockquote><p>On November 22, 1963, three shots rang out in Dallas, President Kennedy died, and the world changed. What if you could change it back? Stephen King's heart-stoppingly dramatic new novel is about a man who travels back in time to prevent the JFK assassination-a thousand page tour de force.</p><p>Following his massively successful novel Under the Dome, King sweeps readers back in time to another moment-a real life moment-when everything went wrong: the JFK assassination. And he introduces readers to a character who has the power to change the course of history.</p><p>Jake Epping is a thirty-five-year-old high school English teacher in Lisbon Falls, Maine, who makes extra money teaching adults in the GED program. He receives an essay from one of the students-a gruesome, harrowing first person story about the night 50 years ago when Harry Dunning's father came home and killed his mother, his sister, and his brother with a hammer. Harry escaped with a smashed leg, as evidenced by his crooked walk.</p><p>Not much later, Jake's friend Al, who runs the local diner, divulges a secret: his storeroom is a portal to 1958. He enlists Jake on an insane-and insanely possible-mission to try to prevent the Kennedy assassination. So begins Jake's new life as George Amberson and his new world of Elvis and JFK, of big American cars and sock hops, of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, who becomes the love of Jake's life-a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.</p><p>A tribute to a simpler era and a devastating exercise in escalating suspense, 11/22/63 is Stephen King at his epic best.</p></blockquote> <p>""It all adds up to one of the best time-travel stories since H. G. Wells. King has captured something wonderful."" â <em>The New York Times</em></p> <p>Â </p>  ",2011,750,0,FALSE,3573,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/71EEF40C-1517-6111-280F54EF8F1AC42C.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/71EF88AA-1517-6111-28096D01BBF86E57.png",

They had been killed by shotgun blasts at close range after being bound and gagged. The father, 48-year-old Herbert W. Clutter, was found in the basement with his son, Kenyon, 15. His wife Bonnie, 45, and a daughter, Nancy, 16, were in their beds. There were no signs of a struggle and nothing had been stolen. The telephone lines had been cut. ""This is apparently the case of a psychopathic killer,"" Sheriff Earl Robinson said... </blockquote>   <p>Fascinated by this brief news item, author Truman Capote, whose book <em>Breakfast at Tiffany's</em> had just been published to great acclaim, traveled with his childhood friend <a href=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/category/All-Categories/name/Harper-Lee/view/items/"" target=""_blank"">Harper Lee</a> (author of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>) to Holcomb, Kansas, and visited the scene of the massacre. Together they interviewed local residents and investigators assigned to the case and took thousands of pages of notes. The killers, Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, were arrested not long after the murders, and Capote ultimately spent six years working on the book. It is considered the originator of the nonfiction novel and the forerunner of the New Journalism movement.</p> <p>The story weaves a complicated psychological story of two parolees who together commit a mass murder, an act they were not capable of individually. Capote's book also details the lives of the victims and the effect the crime had on where they lived. A large part of the story involves the dynamic psychological relationship of the two felons that culminated in this senseless crime. <em>In Cold Blood</em> is often regarded as a pioneering work of true crime.</p>  ",1965,sold,1,FALSE,3588,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/2932CC0F-1517-6111-280B7413DC71A4D7.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/292A33B9-1517-6111-28C104558ABA2965.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/292C291E-1517-6111-28890357E714AB88.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/2928EA52-1517-6111-28E3E324CDD0EBC2.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A30D0FCD-1517-6111-285DE28D2F74C26F.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A30C25EA-1517-6111-28B1AB1C88962C61.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A30CC297-1517-6111-2815F57DB1DF4169.jpg",

She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom of the United States for her contribution to literature in 2007.</p>   <p>Having written several long stories, Harper Lee located an agent in November 1956. The following month at the East 50th townhouse of her friends Michael Brown and Joy Williams Brown, she received a gift of a year's wages with a note: ""You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas."" </p>   <p>Within a year, she had a first draft. Working with J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co. editor Tay Hohoff, she completed <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> in the summer of 1959. Published July 11, 1960, the novel was an immediate bestseller and won great critical acclaim, including the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1961. It remains a bestseller with more than 30 million copies in print. In 1999, it was voted ""Best Novel of the Century"" in a poll by the Library Journal.</p>   <p>Many details of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> are apparently autobiographical. Like Lee, the tomboy Scout is the daughter of a respected small-town Alabama attorney. The plot involves a legal case, the workings of which would have been familiar to Lee, who studied law. Scout's friend Dill is supposed to have been inspired by Lee's childhood friend and neighbor, <a href=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/category/All-Categories/name/Truman-Capote/view/items/"" target=""_blank"">Truman Capote</a>, while Lee is the model for a character in Capote's first novel, <em>Other Voices, Other Rooms</em>.</p>   <p>After completing <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Lee accompanied Capote to Holcomb, Kansas, to assist him in researching what they thought would be an article on a small town's response to the murder of a farmer and his family. Truman Capote expanded the material into his best-selling book, <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/truman-capote-in-cold-blood-signed-first-edition-book"" target=""_blank""><em>In Cold Blood</em></a> (1966).</p>   <p>Since publication of <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>, Lee has granted almost no requests for interviews or public appearances, and with the exception of a few short essays, has published no further writings. She did work on a second novel-<em>The Long Goodbye</em>-eventually filing it away unfinished. During the mid-1980s, she began a book of nonfiction about an Alabama serial murderer, but also put it aside when she was not satisfied. Her withdrawal from public life prompted unfounded speculation that new publications were in the works.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

And slightly later, he adds, ""For it is not metres, but a metre-making argument, that makes a poem"". According to Emerson, a poet who values form over thought is not a poet at all, but rather merely a skilled manipulator of words. For him, a poet must be the articulator of some genuine thought or argument; it does not suffice to merely create a poem solely on the sound and effect of words.</p>   <p>In 1844, the same year that Emerson published his essay, <strong>Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</strong> published ""<strong>The Day is Done</strong>,"" a poem that argues directly against the point made in Emerson's ""The Poet."" Longfellow is hyperaware of the meter, rhyme, word choice, and overall sound of his poem; in fact, those elements are what make the poem a cohesive and successful piece of work. As a result of Longfellow's attention to the effect of the words and seeming disregard for what Emerson would call a ""metre-making argument,"" ""The Day is Done"" serves as a counter-argument to Emerson's initial claim.</p> <p>At Longfellow's funeral, his friend Emerson called him ""a sweet and beautiful soul"". In reality, Longfellow's life was much more difficult than was assumed. He suffered from neuralgia, causing constant pain, and he also had poor eyesight. He wrote to friend Charles Sumner: ""I do not believe anyone can be perfectly well, who has a brain and a heart"". </p> <p>This original handwritten, signed and dated poem has been specially matted in a brown pin-striped fabric not unlike that which Longfellow likely wore in a suit of the period. Each window element is enhanced with Italian hand-marbled paper in a brown, salmon and cocoa peacock motif. The wooden frame is done in a black and brown tortoise shell finish with a rich gold fillet bordering the entire display.</p> <p>If kept out of direct sunlight and maintained in a clean, temperate environment, this beautiful heirloom will provide lasting enjoyment for generations. </p> <p><strong>HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW</strong> (1807-1882) was an American educator and poet whose works include such classics as ""Paul Revere's Ride"" and ""The Song of Hiawatha.""   </p> <p>Longfellow predominantly wrote lyric poetry, known for its musicality, which often presented stories of mythology and legend. He became the most popular American poet of his day and also had success overseas.</p> <p>Over the years, Longfellow's personality had become part of his reputation. He had been presented as a gentle, placid, poetic soul: an image perpetuated by his brother Samuel Longfellow, who wrote an early biography which specifically emphasized these points. As James Russell Lowell said, Longfellow had an ""absolute sweetness, simplicity, and modesty"".</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

A translation of this work had been among his goals when teaching Dante at Harvard, and he had translated small parts of the poem in the early 1840s. Now he plunged into work, translating at the rate of a canto a day. For advice, he gathered weekly evening sessions of his ""Dante Club"" of writer-scholars--among them James Russell Lowell, who had succeeded Longfellow as Smith Professor; <strong>Charles Eliot Norton</strong>, who eventually published his own prose translation of Dante's masterpiece; and William Dean Howells. Longfellow's translation, still respected for its linguistic appreciation and literary merit, appeared in an 1865-1867 three-volume edition, although he completed the translation in spring 1864.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Norman Mailer, Norman,Mailer,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/norman-mailer-letter-signed-to-critic-john-william-corrington/,Typed Letter Signed to Literary Critic,"Revealing typed letter signed by American author Norman Mailer, who writes to the literary critic John William Corrington, apparently in response to an advance look Corrington provided Mailer of his forthcoming review of Mailer's book "" <em>An American Dream</em> ,"" to appear in the Chicago Review (both published in 1965). Aside from its insightful, even instructive content, the desirability of this letter further lies in the fact that Mailer signed his name in full, since most correspondence was signed only as ""Norman."" <strong> </strong> In full: <br/> <p>Â </p> <blockquote><p><em>142 Columbia Heights<br/>Brooklyn 1, New York</em></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><em>June 8, 1965</em></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><em>Dear Mr. Corrington,</em></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><em>I mislaid your letter and didn't come across it again until today, and that was annoying. I do not want you to think you'd get no answer from me. Now the best time for answering is gone. I'm starting work on a novel soon so starting this week I'm going to be acknowledging mail rather than replying. But look, in any case I can hardly tell you that I thought you were or were not on the right track. That would break the game of criticism, for criticism consists of the critics assuming an authority which he knows in his heart cannot be authoritative, and that's the fun of it. So I try never to go over a piece of criticism with the critic. I limit myself to saying I enjoyed reading it or didn't enjoy reading it, and obviously I enjoyed reading your piece or I would not have been annoyed at mislaying it.</em></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><em>At any rate, I don't know whether I can keep it or not, so I'm returning the manuscript to you. When it is printed in Chicago Review, would you ask them to send me a copy?</em></p><p><em>And for now, my best to you,</em></p><p><em>/s/ Norman Mailer</em></p></blockquote> <p><br/>Corrington, in notes for a course he would later teach on ""The Twentieth Century Novel,"" wrote about his critical reviews of Norman Mailer's work, observing that what he had ended up with was ""many loose ends and dangling propositions"" and a concern that what he had managed to write wasn't scholarly at all: </p> <p>""What we are doing here is not scholarship, it is evocation...  It is madness to define a living, growing vision, especially when it belongs to a genius. One only touches it, knowing that however gently one touches, Heisenberg's principle of uncertainty may hold true. Still the attempt must be made... ""</p> <p>It's little wonder, then, that Mailer was flattered by Corrigan's letter, and annoyed he had misplaced it, for it must have contained similar admirations. But Mailer genuinely relates here the truths of ""the game of criticism,"" deferring comment on whether Corrigan was or was not ""on the right track."" A marvelous and revealing look into the minds of both author and critic. </p> <p><em>Citation: John William Corrington, An American Dreamer, 18 (1) Chicago Rev. 58, 66 (1965) (book review of Norman Mailer's ""The American Dream""). </em></p>  ",1965,450,0,FALSE,3800,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/A6F259C2-1517-6111-2825B4F1F85216CE.jpg,
 Norman Mailer, Norman,Mailer,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/norman-mailer-signed-first-edition-gospel-according-to-son/,Signed First Edition Book,"  <p><strong>Signed first edition of Norman Mailer's <em>The Gospel According to the Son</em> in fine, unread condition</strong>; fifth printing in fine dust jacket protected by Mylar cover. Signed in person.</p> <p>For two thousand years, the brief ministry of a young Nazarene preacher has remained the largest single determinant of Western civilization's triumphs and disasters. Here, Norman Mailer has written a novel about Jesus's life. Is God speaking to me? Jesus asks. Or am I hearing voices? If the voices are from God, why has He chosen me as His son? And if they are not from God, then who gave me the power to perform these miracles?</p> <p>It soon becomes evident that we are being told the story of a skilled and most devout carpenter who is living with prodigious questions. The result is an intimately readable account of a man thrust forward by the visions he receives, the sermons he offers, and the miracles he enacts until he comes to the apocalyptic end of his powers.</p> <p><em>The Gospel According to the Son</em> vividly recreates the world of Galilee and Jerusalem two thousand years ago. In a time of uneasy stability, the Holy Land is governed by a complacent but fearful establishment who rule over a despairing underclassâit is a time of great change, open to comparison with our own. Mailer's signal accomplishment is to create for us a man wholly unlike others who is nonetheless filled with passion and doubt, strength and weakness; a protagonist divine and human, a son of God who shares our condition.</p>  ",1997,sold,1,FALSE,3665,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/DAC107F4-1517-6111-28CEB7C3810E4ABA.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/DAC19280-1517-6111-28C69F2968A3B102.jpg",

There he met journalist H. L. Mencken who became the subject for Manchester's master's thesis and first book, <em>Disturber of the Peace</em>. The biography, published in 1951, profiles Mencken, the self-described ""conservative anarchist"" who made his mark as a writer, editor, and political pundit in the 1920s. In 1953 Manchester published his novel <em>The City of Anger</em> fictionally placed in Baltimore and dealing with inner city life and the numbers racket, subjects Manchester had learned about as a big city reporter.</p>   <p>In 1955 Manchester left journalism as a career to became an editor for Wesleyan University and spent the rest of his career there, later becoming an adjunct professor of history and writer-in-residence there.</p>   <p>His best-selling book, <em>The Death of a President</em> (1967) was a detailed account of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, who had been the subject of an earlier book by Manchester. Manchester, who retraced Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald's movements before the assassination, concluded, based on his study of Oswald's psychology and their similar training as Marine sharpshooters, that Oswald acted alone. Manchester had the support of Robert and Jackie Kennedy, but later had a falling out with Robert Kennedy over Manchester's treatment of President Lyndon B. Johnson.</p>   <p>However, before the book could be published Jacqueline Kennedy filed a lawsuit to prevent its publication, even though she had previously authorized it. The suit was settled in 1967, reportedly by Manchester agreeing to drop certain passages dealing with details of Kennedy's family life. In response satirist Paul Krassner published a piece entitled ""The Parts That Were Left Out of the Kennedy Book"", which imagined censored material of an outrageously more scandalous nature than anything that could possibly have been the case. In his collection of essays <em>Controversy</em> (1977), Manchester detailed Kennedy's (and, likely, Johnson's) attempts to suppress the book.</p>   <p>Following the death of his wife in 1998, Manchester suffered two strokes. He announced, to the disappointment of many of his readers, that he would not be able to complete the previously planned third volume of his three part-biography of Churchill, <em>The Last Lion: Winston Spencer Churchill: Defender of the Realm, 1940-1965</em>. He died at the age of 82 on June 1, 2004.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

The surviving cards are of particular historical interest because of the beauty and detail of the design, which was often executed in precious materials and often reproduce members of the Sforza and Visconti families in period garments and settings. Consequently, the cards also offer a glimpse of nobiliar life in Milan, which the two families called home since the 13th century. When commissioned by Filippo Maria Visconti, Duke of Milan, and by his successor Francesco Sforza, the cards were still known as <em>Trionfi</em> (""triumphs"", i.e. trump) cards, and used for everyday playing.Â </p> <p>The text surrounding the faithful reproductions of the original cards is, in effect, a short novel by Italo Calvino, commissioned by renowned Italian publisher Franco Maria Ricci for this edition: it concerns a group of travelers who are struck dumb and can communicate their stories only through Tarot cards, recounted and described by a narrator. (Calvino went on later to ""complete"" the story in a second part, built around another deck of Tarot, published in 1973.)</p> <p>The remaining original cards of the deck are dispersed today: a number of the cards are in the Pierpont Morgan Library, another group at the Accademia Carrara in Bergamo, and others in a private collection, so Ricci's book is the only place where all existing cards are brought together.</p>  ",1975,350,0,FALSE,3554,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9BDF915A-1517-6111-283D8D971C00310C.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9C07468B-1517-6111-28CE6609111D8A30.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/0F8F0CE2-1517-6111-28EE17D8BD5FE4C5.png",Franco Maria Ricci

Considered by many to be among the strangest and most vexing books in the world. Numbered <strong>856</strong> out of a limited printing of just <strong>4000</strong> copies and signed by the artist on the colophon page, this exceedingly hard-to-find set is printed on luxuriously textured Fabriano paper, resplendent in midnight-black silk bindings decorated with a profusion of gilt titling, encased in gorgeous black silk clamshell boxes; in fine condition overall with expected minor shelf wear.</p> <p>The <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em> was written and illustrated by Italian graphic designer and architect, Luigi Serafini during the mid- to late 1970's. The <em>Codex</em> is a masterpiece of fantasy painstakingly illustrating an encyclopedia, a travelogue or scientific study for an imaginary world in a parallel universe, with copious commentary in an incomprehensible language. It is written in a florid script, entirely invented and completely illegible, illustrated with intricate watercolor paintings. The language of the <em>Codex</em> has defied complete analysis by linguists for decades, although the small amount of progress that has been made seems to verify that the book does indeed contain meaningful text. The number system used for sequencing the pages, however, has reputedly been cracked by Bulgarian linguist <a href=""http://www.math.bas.bg/~iad/serafin.html"" target=""_blank"">Ivan Derzhanski</a>.</p>   <p>The <em>Codex</em> appears to be divided into eleven chapters, partitioned into two sections. The first section looks to describe the natural world, dealing with flora, fauna, and physics. The second deals with the humanities, the various aspects of human life: clothing, history, cuisine, architecture and so on. Each chapter seems to treat a general encyclopedic topic. The topics of each separate chapter appear to be as follows:</p> <ol><li>The first chapter describes many alien types of flora: strange flowers, trees that uproot themselves and migrate, etc.</li><li>The second chapter is devoted to the fauna of this alien world, depicting many animals that are surreal variations of the horse, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, birds, etc.</li><li>The third chapter deals with what seems to be a separate kingdom of odd bipedal creatures, apparently engineered for various purposes.</li><li>The fourth chapter deals with something that seems to be physics and chemistry, and is by far the most abstract and enigmatic.</li><li>The fifth chapter deals with bizarre machines and vehicles.</li><li>The sixth chapter explores the general humanities: biology, sexuality, various aboriginal peoples, and even shows examples of plant life and tools (such as pens and wrenches) grafted directly into the human body.</li><li>The seventh chapter is historical. It shows many people (some only vaguely human) of unknown significance, giving their times of birth and death. It also depicts many scenes of historical (and possibly religious) significance. Also included are examples of burial and funereal customs.</li><li>The eighth chapter depicts the history of the Codex's alien writing system.</li><li>The ninth chapter deals with food, dining practices, and clothing.</li><li>The tenth chapter describes bizarre games (including playing cards and board games) and athletic sports.</li><li>The eleventh chapter is devoted entirely to architecture.</li></ol> <p>Many view the <em>Codex</em> as a sort of an elaborate parody of the real world. The invented script of the book imitates Western-style writing systems (left-to-right writing in rows; an alphabet with uppercase and lowercase; probably a separate set of symbols for writing numerals) but is much more curvilinear reminding some of Semitic scripts. The writing seems to have been designed to appear, but not actually be, meaningful, like the <em>Voynich Manuscript</em>. Whilte subsequent lesser editions have been published and are expensive in their right, this 1981 first edition is extremely hard-to-find, with few known copies in libraries around the world.</p> <p>First released in this limited Italian edition in 1981, the book has periodically been published in France, Spain, and the United States. The author, an Italian artist, has never spoken about the origins of the book or the meaning of his language, but theorists surmise that it is inspired by the Borges story ""TlÃ¶n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"" about a book from the (fictional) country of Uqbar that documents every aspect of an imaginary world called TlÃ¶n. Borges writes: ""The metaphysicians of TlÃ¶n are not looking for truth, nor even for an approximation of it; they are after a kind of amazement."" </p> <p>In September 2011 the esteemed British Museum mounted a special exhibition, ""Out of this World: But Not as You Know It,"" featuring many of the world's most influential science fiction treasures, among them the <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em>.</p> <p>A fascinating academic treatise, by Professor Peter Schwenger of Mt. Saint Vincent University in Halifax, discusses the Codex in some detail <a href=""http://faculty.msvu.ca/pschwenger/codex.htm"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

 Beryl Markham, Beryl,Markham,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/beryl-markham-west-with-the-night-signed-first-edition/,"Signed First Edition ""West with the Night""","  <p><strong>Signed first edition, first printing of Beryl Markham's extraordinary memoir <em>West with the Night</em>, published to popular acclaim in 1942. Signed without inscription on first free endpaper and dated July 1942 on inside cover. </strong>Publisher: Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1942. First American Edition, first printing. Very good condition with facsimile dustjacket.<strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>Beryl Markham</strong> (1902-1986) was a British-born Kenyan aviator (one of the first bush pilots), adventurer, racehorse trainer and author. During the pioneer days of aviation, she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic from east to west. She is now primarily remembered as the author of her memoir, West with the Night. </p> <p>Although the book enjoyed initial critical acclaim and strong sales following its 1942 publication, war-weary readers on both sides of the Atlantic found it lacking sufficient escapism to divert their attention from the world's clear and present dangers, and the book foundered out of print for four decadesâuntil 1983, when it was ""discovered"" that no less a critic than Ernest Hemingway had quite favorably praised the book in a 1942 letter to his editor, Maxwell Perkins:</p> <blockquote><p>""Did you read Beryl Markham's book, â<em>West with the Night</em>'? I knew her fairly well in Africa and never would have suspected that she could and would put pen to paper except to write in her flyer's log book. As it is, she has written so well, and marvelously well, that I was completely ashamed of myself as a writer. I felt that I was simply a carpenter with words, picking up whatever was furnished on the job and some times making an okay pig pen. But [she] can write rings around all of us who consider ourselves as writers.... I wish you would get it and read it because it is really a bloody wonderful book.""</p></blockquote> <p><em>West with the Night</em> is the story of Beryl Markhamâaviator, racehorse trainer, beautyâand her life in the Kenya of the 1920s and '30s. The book is a true classic, one that deserves the same acclaim and readership as the work of her contemporaries Ernest Hemingway, Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, and Isak Dinesen. If the first responsibility of a memoirist is to lead a life worth writing about, Markham succeeded beyond all measure. Born Beryl Clutterbuck in the middle of England, she and her father moved to Kenya when she was a girl, and she grew up with a zebra for a pet; horses for friends; baboons, lions, and gazelles for neighbors. She made money by scouting elephants from a tiny plane. And she would spend most of the rest of her life in East Africa as an adventurer, a racehorse trainer, and an aviatrixâshe became the first person to fly nonstop from Europe to America, the first woman to fly solo east to west across the Atlantic. Hers was indisputably a life full of adventure and beauty. </p>  ",1942,sold,1,FALSE,3824,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/452D56A1-1517-6111-285A1A6E14C13C3D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/452E1D9B-1517-6111-289BFF04F9BD580E.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/452EAD0A-1517-6111-2859A7452777A2E1.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/452F3525-1517-6111-284FD27A4FA22D0A.jpg",

But the book I like best is <em>Cakes and Ale</em> ... because in its pages lives for me again the woman with the lovely smile who was the model for Rosie Driffield.""</p> <p>Maugham writes, in full:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Dear Don Otto,</em></p><p><em>Thank you for your charming letter and all the nice things you say. It was extremely kind of you to write me; I was touched and much pleased.</em></p><p><em>I am so glad that you liked ""Cakes and Ale"" it is my favourite book. </em></p><p><em>Yours sincerely,<br/></em><em>W. S. Maugham</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>WILLIAM SOMERSET MAUGHAM</strong> (1874-1965) was an English playwright, novelist and short story writer. He was one of the most popular authors of his era, and reputedly the highest paid of his profession during the 1930s.<strong><br/></strong></p> <p>Maugham's masterpiece is generally agreed to be <em>Of Human Bondage</em>, a semi-autobiographical novel that deals with the life of the main character Philip Carey, who like Maugham, was orphaned, and brought up by his pious uncle. Philip's clubfoot causes him endless self-consciousness and embarrassment, echoing Maugham's struggles with his stutter. Later successful novels were also based on real-life characters: <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em> fictionalizes the life of Paul Gauguin; and <em>Cakes and Ale</em> contains thinly veiled characterizations of authors Thomas Hardy and Hugh Walpole. Maugham's last major novel, <em>The Razor's Edge</em>, published in 1944, was a departure for him in many ways. While much of the novel takes place in Europe, its main characters are American, not British. The protagonist is a disillusioned veteran of World War I who abandons his wealthy friends and lifestyle, travelling to India seeking enlightenment. The story's themes of Eastern mysticism and war-weariness struck a chord with readers as World War II waned, and a movie adaptation quickly followed.<br/><br/>Among his short stories, some of the most memorable are those dealing with the lives of Western, mostly British, colonists in the Far East, and are typically concerned with the emotional toll exacted on the colonists by their isolation. Some of his more outstanding works in this genre include <em>Rain</em>, <em>Footprints In The Jungle</em> and <em>The Outstation</em>. <em>Rain</em>, in particular, which charts the moral disintegration of a missionary attempting to convert the Pacific island prostitute Sadie Thompson, has kept its fame and been made into a movie several times. Maugham said that many of his short stories presented themselves to him in the stories he heard during his travels in the outposts of the Empire. He left behind a long string of angry former hosts, and a contemporary anti-Maugham writer retraced his footsteps and wrote a record of his journeys called <em>Gin And Bitters</em>. Maugham's restrained prose allows him to explore the resulting tensions and passions without appearing melodramatic.

The fact that you have left out four pages of your play does not however make criticism impossible. A one-act play would be in length about 30 pages of your manuscript, so that, you see, it begins by falling just short of ""the genuine article."" </em></p><p><em>But in any case, the genuine article is not only the most difficult form of writing that there is, but the most difficult piece of property to sell. Begin with something easier. Write an impression of your day's work, and send it to one of your local papers as a start; if you can't get an article accepted by an editor you are not likely to get a play accepted by a manager. Try an editor with this little sketch if you like â only send him all the pages, and a stamped addressed envelope for its return. I suggest this, because I think from what I have read that there is promise of something better. So practice on the editors â and good luck to you.</em></p><p><em>Yours sincerely<br/>A A Milne</em></p><p><em>Always write your name and address on a manuscript.</em></p></blockquote>   <p>At the time, Milne was an editor for <em>Punch</em> magazine and a   successfulÂ playwright himself. The letter is penned entirely in the author's own hand and is signed by  him. Two-page lettersÂ by Milne are extremely scarce.  </p> <p>This important letter was written from Milne's home at Mallord Street, Chelsea, where both his son Christopher and his most famous character ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" were born (11 Mallord Street had beenÂ renumbered 13, which Milne corrected on letterhead). Milne's first book written at Mallord Street was <em>When We Were Very Young </em>(1924), followed by <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> (1926), <em>Now We are Six</em> (1927) and <em>The House at Pooh Corner</em> (1928). Milne's famous character ""Christopher Robin"" was based upon his son, Christopher Robin Milne. Winnie-the-Pooh, the fictional bear often shortened to Pooh Bear or simply Pooh, is among the most enduring of all fictional characters. </p>   <p>This very rare letter remains in good toÂ fair condition [see images].Â Tape repair at fold, some soiling, creased at folds, edge wear, etc. All in all, this desirableÂ two-page letter remains very presentable.Â Letter occupiesÂ two sides of one sheet (i.e. two pages) andÂ sheetÂ measures approx 5.5"" x 7.25"". </p>   <p><strong>Alan Alexander Milne </strong>(1882-1956) was an English author, and the creator of the iconic ""Winnie the Pooh"", the beloved stuffed bear who starred in a series of his books and much later in the animated films of Walt Disney. Winnie the Pooh has endured as one of the most popular and widely recognized fictional characters in the world. Milne was both an author and playwright who found his greatest success writing tales for children. His 1924 book of poetry <em>When We Were Very Young</em> soon became a classic. The 38th poem in the book, ""Teddy Bear"", originally appeared in <em>Punch</em> magazine in 1923, and became the first appearance of the now famous character ""Winnie-the-Pooh"". Milne's book by the same name (<em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em>) was initially published three years later. This seminal children's text was inspired in part by the stuffed toys of Milne's son, Christopher Robin, who appears in the stories with Pooh.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""text/css"" http-equiv=""Content-Style-Type""/><title></title><meta content=""Cocoa HTML Writer"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""1038.32"" name=""CocoaVersion""/><style type=""text/css"">font.f1 {font: 12.0px Helvetica}</style><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""text/css"" http-equiv=""Content-Style-Type""/><title></title><meta content=""Cocoa HTML Writer"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""1038.32"" name=""CocoaVersion""/><style type=""text/css"">font.f1 {font: 12.0px Helvetica}</style><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""content-type""/>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Through the years he published nearly 600 articles in scientific journals          and in popular magazines, including Natural History, National Geographic,          and Scientific Monthly. In 1947 he published an account of his 1912 whaling          voyage as <em>Logbook for Grace</em>, derived from his original diary and letters          to his wife. Well written, it primarily represents Murphy's acceptance          of the already declining whaling industry and his own enthusiasm for gathering          information on subantarctic birds and mammals. In A Dead Whale or a Stove          Boat (1967) he presented photographs of whaling that he had taken and          developed during the 1912 trip. </p>   <p>Murphy was an early conservationist who concentrated his continuing efforts          on Long Island, New York, where he and his family lived for many years.          He was the first president of the Long Island chapter of the Nature Conservancy,          which obtained natural habitat locally for preservation, and he was an          adviser on the Fire Island National Seashore.

Together with antique print, over 100 years old, of Parrish's Villa Pliniana as commissioned by the novelist Edith Wharton for her book ""Italian Villas and Their Gardens,"" published in 1904. Her description of the Villa Pliniana on Lake Como is one of the most effusive, appealing to any Italophile:</p> <blockquote><p>Just across [Lake Como], in the deep shade of the wooded cliffs beneath the Pizzo di Torno, lies another villa still more steeped in the Italian garden-magic. This is the Villa Pliniana, built in 1570 by the Count Anguissola of Piacenza, and now the property of the Trotti family of Milan. The place takes its name from an intermittent spring in the court, which is supposed to be the one described by Pliny in one of his letters; and it is farther celebrated as being the coolest villa on Como. It lies on a small bay on the east side of the lake, and faces due north, so that, while the villas of Cernobbio are bathed in sunlight, a deep green shade envelops it. The house stands on a narrow ledge, its foundations projecting into the lake, and its back built against the almost vertical wooded cliff which protects it from the southern sun. Down this cliff pours a foaming mountain torrent from the Val di Calore, just beneath the peak of Torno; and this torrent the architect of the Villa Pliniana has captured in its descent to the lake and carried through the central apartment of the villa. </p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>The effect produced is unlike anything else, even in the wonderland of Italian gardens. The two wings of the house, a plain and somewhat melancholy-looking structure, are joined by an open arcaded room, against the back wall of which the torrent pours down, over stonework tremulous with moss and ferns, gushing out gain beneath the balustrade of the loggia, where it makes a great semicircle of glittering whiteness in the dark-green waters of the lake. The old house is saturated with the freshness and drenched with the flying spray of the caged torrent. The bare vaulted rooms reverberate with it, the stone floors are green with its dampness, the air quivers with its cool incessant rush. The contrast of this dusky dripping loggia, on its perpetually shaded bay, with the blazing blue waters of the lake and their sun-steeped western shores, is one of the most wonderful effects in sensation that the Italian villa-art has ever devised. </p></blockquote> <blockquote><p>The architect, not satisfied with diverting a part of the torrent to cool his house, has led the rest in a fall down the cliff immediately adjoining the villa, and has designed winding paths through the woods from which one may look down on the bright rush of the waters.</p></blockquote> <p><strong>MAXFIELD PARRISH (1870-1966)</strong> American painter and illustrator, best known as an illustrator for advertisements, magazines, and such books as Mother Goose in Prose and The Golden Age. Parrish's art features dazzlingly luminous colors; the color Parrish blue was named in acknowledgement. He achieved the results by means of a technique called glazing where bright layers of oil color separated by varnish are applied alternately over a base rendering (Parrish usually used a blue and white monochromatic under-painting).</p>   <p>He would build-up the depth in his paintings by photographing, enlarging, projecting and tracing half or full size objects or figures. Parrish then cut out and placed the images on his canvas, covering them with thick, but clear, layers of glaze. The result is realism of elegiac vivacity. His work achieves a unique three-dimensional appearance, which does not translate well to coffee table books.</p>  ",,750,0,FALSE,3223,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/42DC59FD-1517-6111-28290EDA8C28869D.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/14FB392E-3048-C0CE-5568448A22824C95.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/42DE433F-1517-6111-283F94440D04BF8C.jpg",

Parrish's art features dazzlingly luminous colors; the color ""Parrish blue"" was named in acknowledgement of his prolific use of that unique blend. He achieved the results by means of a technique called glazing where bright layers of oil color separated by varnish are applied alternately over a base rendering (Parrish usually used a blue and white monochromatic underpainting).</p> <p>Parrish would build up the depth in his paintings by photographing, enlarging, projecting and tracing half- or full-size objects or figures. Parrish then cut out and placed the images on his canvas, covering them with thick, but clear, layers of glaze. The result is realism of elegiac vivacity. His work achieves a unique three-dimensional appearance.</p>   <p>Parrish devised many innovative techniques which no other major artist has successfully copied. A technique which Parrish used frequently involved creating a large piece of cloth with a geometric pattern in stark black-and-white (such as alternate black and white squares, or a regular pattern of black circles on a white background). A human model (often Parrish himself) would then pose for a photograph with this cloth draped naturally on his or her body in a manner which intentionally distorted the pattern. Parrish would develop a transparency of the photo, then project this onto the canvas of his current work in progress. Using black graphite on the white canvas, Parrish would painstakingly trace and fill in all the black portions of the projected photo. The result was astonishing: in the finished painting, a human figure would be seen wearing a distinctive geometrically-patterned cloth which draped realistically and accurately.</p>   <p>Â </p>   <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

This is an effusive, richly detailed letter to his friends, James and Barbara Byrnes, from the Hotel Crillon in Madrid, dated June 12, 1952. Roth's signatureâindeed, anything written or signed by himâis one of the more elusive collectibles, since very little of his material has ever come to market.</strong></p> <p>Roth discusses his new friendship with Pablo Picasso, how Picasso wants to buy several of his photographs with plans to contribute the frontispiece for Roth's new book; plans for showings throughout Europe; a new photographic series on bullfighting with the matador Pepe Dominguin (whose father, the great Domingo, was chronicled in Ernest Hemingway's book The Dangerous Summer).</p> <p>Sanford Roth and his wife Beulah, both extensive world travelers, met, entertained, photographed, and became friends with the who's who of post World War II Europe and Hollywood-photographic subjects including Albert Einstein, Alfred Hitchcock, James Dean (who became a personal friend), Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Audrey Hepburn, Aldous Huxley, NoÃ«l Coward, Jimmy Stewart, Christopher Isherwood, Louis Armstrong, Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, John Wayne, Jean Cocteau, Peter Ustinov, Tennessee Williams, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, and many others.</p> <p>Roth first met James Dean on the set of Giant and immediately became friends. Dean often visited their home and treated the Roths as adoptive parents. Poignantly, Sanford Roth was in James Dean's Ford station wagon driving behind Dean's new Porsche Spyder on the way to the Salinas Road Races on September 30, 1955, when Dean was killed in a late afternoon traffic accident. Roth took the now famous post-accident photographs. </p> <p>James B. Byrnes was the first curator of modern and contemporary art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (1946-1952), and his wife Barbara owned the American Contemporary Gallery on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>  ",1952,500,0,FALSE,3797,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8842A1AB-1517-6111-285DEC348F9D9454.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8843196A-1517-6111-28A25B3DCFDABCCD.jpg",

After returning to Paris from his Swiss exile during World War I, Kahnweiler opened the Galerie Simon at 29 rue d'Astorg, which was named after his partner and financial backer AndrÃ© Cahen, known as AndrÃ© Simon.

 Pablo Picasso, Pablo,Picasso,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/pablo-picasso-signature-autograph-signed/,Signature,"  <p><strong>Bold signature in blue ballpoint on 4"" x 7"" paper, likely removed from a book.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>PABLO PICASSO</strong> (1881-1973), born Pablo Diego JosÃ© Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno MarÃ­a de los Remedios Cipriano de la SantÃ­sima Trinidad Martyr Patricio Clito RuÃ­z y Picasso, was an Andalusian-Spanish painter, draughtsman, and sculptor. As one of the most recognized figures in twentieth-century art, he is best known for co-founding the Cubist movement and for the wide variety of styles embodied in his work. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist <em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em> (1907) and his depiction of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War, <em>Guernica</em> (1937). </p>   <p>After studying art in Madrid, Picasso made his first trip to Paris in 1900, then the art capital of Europe. There, he met his first Parisian friend, the journalist and poet Max Jacob, who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work had to be burned to keep the small room warm. In Madrid in 1901, Picasso and his anarchist friend Francisco de AsÃ­s Soler founded the magazine <em>Arte Joven</em> (Young Art), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. From that day, he started to sign his work simply Picasso, while before he had signed Pablo Ruiz y Picasso.</p>   <p>In the early twentieth century, Picasso divided his time between Barcelona and Paris. In 1904, in the middle of a storm, he met Fernande Olivier, a Bohemian artist who became his mistress. Olivier appears in many of his Rose period paintings. After acquiring fame and some fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, whom he called Eva. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works.</p>   <p>In Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the Montmartre and Montparnasse quarters, including AndrÃ© Breton, poet Guillaume Apollinaire, writer Alfred Jarry, and Gertrude Stein. Apollinaire was arrested on suspicion of stealing the Mona Lisa from the Louvre in 1911. Apollonaire pointed to his friend Picasso, who was also brought in for questioning, but both were later exonerated.</p>   <p>Picasso's work is often categorized into periods. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the Blue Period (1901-1904), the Rose Period (1905-1907), the African-influenced Period (1908-1909), Analytic Cubism (1909-1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912-1919).</p>   <p>At the time of his death many of his paintings were in his possession, as he had kept off the art market what he didn't need to sell. In addition, Picasso had a considerable collection of the work of other famous artists, some his contemporaries, such as Henri Matisse, with whom he had exchanged works. Since Picasso left no will, his death duties (estate tax) to the French state were paid in the form of his works and others from his collection. These works form the core of the immense and representative collection of the MusÃ©e Picasso in Paris.</p>   <p>Several paintings by Picasso rank among the most expensive paintings in the world. <em>GarÃ§on Ã  la pipe</em> sold for $104 million at Sotheby's on May 4, 2004, establishing a new price record. <em>Dora Maar au Chat</em> sold for $95.2 million at Sotheby's on May 3, 2006.</p>   <p>As of 2004, Picasso had remained the top ranked artist (based on sales of his works at auctions) according to the <em>Art Market Trends</em> report.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

She worked as a screenwriter in Hollywood and had a play produced on Broadway in 1932. She first achieved fame with <em>The Fountainhead</em> (1943), and her best-known workâthe philosophical novel <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>âwas published in 1957.<br/><br/>Her political views, reflected in both her fiction and her theoretical work, emphasize individualism, laissez-faire capitalism, and the constitutional protection of the right to life, liberty, and property. She was a fierce opponent of all forms of collectivism and statism, including fascism, communism, and the welfare state.<br/><br/>Rand's first major success came with <em>The Fountainhead</em> in 1943, a romantic drama and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years. The novel centers around an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark, and his struggle against what Rand described as ""second-handers"" - those who attempt to live through others, placing others above self. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the Bobbs-Merrill Company on the insistence of editorial board member Archibald Ogden. The novel was adapted as a film in 1949, produced by Warner Brothers, starring Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal, with the screenplay written by Rand herself. She had already written screenplays for two other Hollywood movies, <em>Love Letters</em> and <em>You Came Along</em>. <em>The Fountainhead</em> eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. It continues to sell about 100,000 copies per year.<br/><br/>Rand's magnum opus, the 1,100-page <em>Atlas Shrugged</em>, was published in 1957. Because of the success of <em>The Fountainhead</em>, the initial print run was 100,000 copies, and the book went on to become an international bestseller, with many interviewees citing it as the book that most influenced them. It currently sells almost 200,000 copies annually. The theme of <em>Atlas Shrugged</em> is the morality of rational self-interest. It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her idea of human greatness. The plot involves a dystopian United States in which industrialists and other creative individuals go on strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The hero, John Galt, describes the strike as ""stopping the motor of the world"" by withdrawing the people that Rand saw as contributing the most to the nation's productivity and creativity. With their strike, they aim to demonstrate that, without ""the men of the mind,"" the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of mystery and science fiction, and contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, including a lengthy monologue delivered by John Galt.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Whimsically humanizing the work of the French master has thus devised a new kind of invention, a whole fantastic botanical world whose leaves, printed as illustrations contained in pockets on each page that can be removed and more closely examined, form an enchanted forest of trees, animation and mutant plantsâa celebration of the eternal vitality of natural history.</p> <p>This large-format volume has a brown canvas cover on which is reproduced the original covers of <em>Storie Naturali</em> as published by BUR in 1959, with the lenticular image of a fox (in French: <em>renard</em>). The pages are of the highest quality paper, the lyrical text, in Italian, is from Renard's original book. This fascinating book contains 20 pockets that contain the beautifully imagined herbarium leaves.</p> <p>At 262 pages with pockets and inserts, <em>Storie Naturali</em> is a limited edition of 660 copies numbered and signed by the artist, of which this copy is #147. Published by Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli, Milan, in 2009.</p> <h3>Biography <br/></h3> <p><strong>Luigi Serafini</strong> (born on 4 August, 1949 in Rome, Italy) is an Italian artist, architect and designer. Graduated with a BA in Architecture at the Politecnico in Milan, Serafini started working as a designer, in cooperation with Gruppo Memphis, headed by architect Ettore Sottsass. He also worked for Italian television and several movie production companies, among them Federico Fellini's La Voce della Luna, in addition to stage, light and costume designing for the great La Scala theater in Milan. He has created scenery, lighting and costumes for the ballet The Jazz Calendar by Frederick Ashton at Teatro alla Scala and worked also for the Piccolo Teatro di Milano.</p> <p>Among his most significant works the renowned <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em>âan illustrated encyclopedia of imaginary vegetal and animal species in an undecipherable languageâpublished in 1981 by Franco Maria Ricci and reprinted by Rizzoli in 2006 should be mentioned. The <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em> was originally released in a limited edition of 4,000 artfully-bound copies in 1981. It has been later republished on four occasions, first in a 1983 English language edition; then in English, Spanish and French editions in the 1990s, each again limited to 5,000 copies; and finally in a more widely printed 2006 edition. In 1984 he illustrated <em>Pulcinellopedia (piccola)</em> by P. Cetrulo (published by Longanesi), with a suite of pencil drawings focusing on the Neapolitan masque of Pulcinella. He also published collections of short stories for Bompiani, Archinto, Fandango and several magazines. </p> <p>In 2003 he completed a polychrome bronze sculpture <em>Carpe Diem</em> and some bas-reliefs for one of the Naples subway stations (Mater Dei). In May 2007, he held an ""ontological exhibition"" Luna Pac at P.A.C. (the Pavilion of Contemporary Art) in Milan. In the same year the P.A.C. has paid homage to the artistic universe of Luigi Serafini by showing the 100 original plates of the Codex. Serafini has been a Banff Center visiting artist and has exhibited at the Fondazione Mudima in Milan, the XIII Quadriennale, the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome, the Futurarium and the Didael gallery. In July 2008 he completed a polychrome installation BalanÃ§oires sans FrontiÃ¨res (Altalene senza Frontiere) in Castasegna, Switzerland. In 2009 Serafini illustrated <em>Storie Naturali</em>, a reinterpretation of <em>Histoires naturelles</em> (Natural Histories) by Jules Renard, published by Rizzoli in a signed, limited edition of 660 copies.</p> <p>Roland Barthes, Italo Calvino, Federico Fellini, Leonardo Sciascia, Giorgio Manganelli, Giorgio Soavi, Federico Zeri, Achille Bonito Oliva, Douglas Hofstadter, Philippe DecoufflÃ© and Vittorio Sgarbi have engaged in the analisys of Serafini's works. Calvino has epitomized the mechanisms and the rhetorical devices in his oeuvre: ""...like in Ovidio's Metamorphoses, Serafini believes in the contiguity and permeability of every territory of the existing: the anatomic and the mechanic elements exchange their morphologies, the human and the vegetal reigns find their mutual completeness...the wild and the metropolitan, the writing and the living.""</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Canvas measures 7"" x 9"", framing overall 13.5"" x 16"".</p> <p>The art of Paul Renard can best described as a true love story. He remained faithful his entire live to painting the soft scenes that he saw around him as a boy of the bustling sidewalks of Paris. He applied his sensitive and consuming fascination, with seeking to capture the beauty of French city life and country rivers on canvas as he saw them right up until his death. He wanted others to sense, see and feel what he spent his life adoring. </p> <p>Moreover, as in the greatest of love stories, Renard patiently studied and savored every nuance of his chosen affection. From the magnificence of lush river scenes of his birthplace in La Grenouillere, to the life-swollen Parisian streets, his magic brush strokes entice the viewer to experience the evanescence of the life he knew. There exists what might even be called a gentleness in the treatment of subjects on canvas, and an obvious respect for the integration of nature with mankind. He shares with the viewer his vision of the delicate beauty of light, color, humanity, and balance whether the subject is cobblestone streets, flowers, animals, flowing waters, or people tending to their daily lives. Renard added his very special love into each and every object. He sees, after all, only the beauty of his great mistress.</p>  ",,3000,0,FALSE,3791,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/9B68C098-1517-6111-28557526BF9884B7.jpg,

Educated at Reed College (A.B.) and the University of California (M.A., Ph.D.), her professional life began conventionally enough, as member of the English faculty at California, Central Washington, Chicago, Black Mountain. These assignments brought her face to face with a question: ""Why is it we are all so well-educated and brilliant and gifted and artistic and idealistic and distinguished in scholarship, that we are so selfish and scheming and dishonest and begrudging and impatient and disrespectful of others?""</p> <p>The answer, she concluded, was to be sought in arts of transformation: pottery, poetry, alchemy, spiritual self-development. Her life since then had been just such a quest: creation in pots and in words joined with bold, original thought and with many occasions of sharing. As speaker, artist in residence, participator in conferences and seminars she has offered her search and her wisdom to hundreds of students and peers at Colby, Penn State, Antioch, Goldsmiths College (University of London), and Haystack School of Crafts, to name a few.

This is an effusive, richly detailed letter to his friends, James and Barbara Byrnes, from the Hotel Crillon in Madrid, dated June 12, 1952. Roth's signatureâindeed, anything written or signed by himâis one of the more elusive collectibles, since very little of his material has ever come to market.</strong></p> <p>Roth discusses his new friendship with Pablo Picasso, how Picasso wants to buy several of his photographs with plans to contribute the frontispiece for Roth's new book; plans for showings throughout Europe; a new photographic series on bullfighting with the matador Pepe Dominguin (whose father, the great Domingo, was chronicled in Ernest Hemingway's book The Dangerous Summer).</p> <p>Sanford Roth and his wife Beulah, both extensive world travelers, met, entertained, photographed, and became friends with the who's who of post World War II Europe and Hollywood-photographic subjects including Albert Einstein, Alfred Hitchcock, James Dean (who became a personal friend), Judy Garland, Joan Crawford, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Audrey Hepburn, Aldous Huxley, NoÃ«l Coward, Jimmy Stewart, Christopher Isherwood, Louis Armstrong, Paul Newman, Elizabeth Taylor, Rock Hudson, Grace Kelly, Sophia Loren, John Wayne, Jean Cocteau, Peter Ustinov, Tennessee Williams, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, and many others.</p> <p>Roth first met James Dean on the set of Giant and immediately became friends. Dean often visited their home and treated the Roths as adoptive parents. Poignantly, Sanford Roth was in James Dean's Ford station wagon driving behind Dean's new Porsche Spyder on the way to the Salinas Road Races on September 30, 1955, when Dean was killed in a late afternoon traffic accident. Roth took the now famous post-accident photographs. </p> <p>James B. Byrnes was the first curator of modern and contemporary art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (1946-1952), and his wife Barbara owned the American Contemporary Gallery on Hollywood Boulevard.</p>  ",1952,500,0,FALSE,3797,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8842A1AB-1517-6111-285DEC348F9D9454.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8843196A-1517-6111-28A25B3DCFDABCCD.jpg",

As with his previous books, Rushdie heavily used magical realism and relied heavily on contemporary events and people to create his characters. The title refers to the so-called ""satanic verses"", a group of alleged Qur'anic verses that allow intercessory prayers to be made to three Pagan Meccan goddesses: Allat, Uzza, and Manat. The part of the story that deals with the ""satanic verses"" was based on accounts from historians al-Waqidi and al-Tabari.</p>   <p>In the United Kingdom, the book received positive reviews.

In February 1989, the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, issued a fatwa calling on all good Muslims to kill or help kill Rushdie and his publishers. Following the fatwa, Rushdie was put under police protection by the British government.

 John Ruskin, John,Ruskin,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/robert-browning-autograph-letter-signed-john-ruskin/,Autograph Letter Signed to Art Critic John Ruskin,"  <p><strong>Autograph Letter Signed by the English poet Robert Browning, dated August 12, 1884, on his personal stationery; 4.5"" x 7"" (11.5cm x 17.8cm). Addressed to the great Victorian art critic John Ruskin, who 44 years earlier had written a scathing review of one of Browning's earlier poetic works.</strong> In full:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Aug 12 1884</strong></p></blockquote> <blockquote><p><strong>Dear Mr Ruskin,</strong></p><p><strong>	The accompanying letter was forwarded to me by its writer, my friend Mrs. Bloomfield Moore, with a request that I would insert the addrefs <em>(sic)</em> and add an authenticating word or two. Of the work mentioned, I know nothing: but I have had experience of Mrs. Moore's great love of art, and extraordinary munificence in purchasing pictures for presentation to the galleries of Philadelphia, Boston and New York. I hope you remember me as I shall ever remember you. </strong></p><p><strong>Being affectionately yours,<br/>Robert Browning</strong></p></blockquote> <p><em><strong>Robert Browning's Relationship with John Ruskin</strong></em><br/>In 1840 Browning published Sordello, a long narrative poem based on the murky history of the medieval Italian troubadour Sordello da Goito. The reviews were very harsh and it soon came to be known as the most incomprehensible poem of its time.  It gained a reputation as ""unintelligible"" and ""meaningless,"" establishing Browning as an obscure poet. The critic John Ruskin said the poem was ""...worse than the worst Alpine Glacier I ever crossed. Bright &amp; deep enough truly, but so full of clefts that half the journey has to be made with ladder &amp; hatchet."" Browning himself came to make light of the poem, saying it was ""praised by the units, cursed by the tens, unmeddled with by the hundreds."" Ezra Pound began the process of reversing this legacy when he declared it ""probably the greatest poem in English."" (<a href=""http://www.georgetowncollege.edu/departments/english/burch/robert_browning.htm"" target=""_blank"">Reference</a>)</p> <p>The extensive correspondence between John Ruskin and both Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning forms a fascinating exchange among three distinguished Victorian literary figures. As noted by University of Texas at Austin scholar, the late David deLaura, ""The relationship was initiated by Ruskin, who praised Mrs. Browning profusely in his [critical] works of the 1850s. The feeling between Ruskin and Mrs. Browning was obviously intense, and drew from Ruskin an intimacy concerning himself disproportionate to their limited encounters. Robert, though he obviously kept in the background and seems rarely to have sought out Ruskin, was provoked by Ruskin at least three times to a spirited defense of his art, and after Mrs. Browning's death in 1861 dealings between the two men continued to be rather frequent.""</p> <p><em><strong>This curious item appeared in The New York Times Saturday Review on August 19, 1899:</strong></em></p> <blockquote>The interest in Robert Browning will not be diminished in the least by the fact that his heart was in the keeping for a long time of a fair Philadelphian, whose death occurred in London a few months ago. For years Mrs. Bloomfield Moore of that city was the poet's most cherished idol. At one time the idea was rife that Mrs. Moore was engaged to be married to him. It is true that the deepest friendship existed between the poet and Mrs. Moore. That it did not result in marriage after the death of Elizabeth Barrett Browning was not due to Mr. Browning's reluctance to take an American bride. One of Mr. Browning's last works, ""Ferishta's Fancies,"" shows that he was capable in the last years of his life of writing the most passionate love lyrics. To those who are able to read between the lines these lyrics, in the language of Mrs. Moore, suggested that the poet was not as well satisfied with Platonic love as was the author of ""Agatha's Friendship,"" the novel that was published twenty-five years ago from Mrs. Moore's pen. The nature of Mrs. Moore's feelings for Browning was admirably expressed in one of her own poems, ""On the Heights,"" which was published a dozen years ago in London by the Remingtons. Mrs. Moore is the authority for this statement, which was originally made under her direction. Â© <em>The New York Times</em> </blockquote> <p><strong>ROBERT BROWNING</strong> (1812-1889) was an English poet and playwright whose mastery of dramatic verse, especially dramatic monologues, made him one of the foremost Victorian poets. Browning's poetry was known to the cognoscenti from fairly early on in his life, but he remained relatively obscure as a poet till his middle age. (In the middle of the century, Tennyson was much better known.) In Florence he worked on the poems that eventually comprised his two-volume Men and Women, for which he is now well known; in 1855, however, when these were published, they made little impact. It was only after his wife's death, in 1861, when he returned to England and became part of the London literary scene, that his reputation started to take off.</p> <p><strong>JOHN RUSKIN</strong> (1819-1900) was the leading English art critic of the Victorian era, also an art patron, draughtsman, watercolorist, a prominent social thinker and philanthropist. He wrote on subjects ranging from geology to architecture, myth to ornithology, literature to education, and botany to political economy. His writing styles and literary forms were equally varied. Ruskin penned essays and treatises, poetry and lectures, travel guides and manuals, letters and even a fairy tale. </p> <p><strong>CLARA (JESSUP) MOORE</strong> (1824-1899) was a distinguished poet, novelist and philanthropist. In 1842 she married Bloomfield Haines Moore, a prominent Philadelphia businessman. Clara was Robert Browning's closest friend and delivered the eulogy on the occasion of his death in December 1889.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

His most famous description of the city is as ""Hog Butcher for the World/Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat/Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler,/Stormy, Husky, Brawling, and City of the Big Shoulders.""</p>   <p>Sandburg is also remembered by generations of children for his <em>Rootabaga Stories</em> and <em>Rootabaga Pigeons</em>, a series of whimsical, sometimes melancholy stories he originally created for his own daughters. The <em>Rootabaga Stories</em> were born of Sandburg's desire for ""American fairy tales"" to match American childhood. He felt that the European stories involving royalty and knights were inappropriate, and so populated his stories with skyscrapers, trains, corn fairies and the ""Five Marvelous Pretzels"".</p>   <p>Sandburg earned one Pulitzer Prize for his collection <em>The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg</em>, and another for his biography of Abraham Lincoln, <em>Abraham Lincoln: The War Years</em>.

 Luigi Serafini, Luigi,Serafini,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/codex-seraphinianus-signed-first-edition-luigi-serafini-1981-autographed/,Codex Seraphinianus Signed 2-Volume Limited First Edition,"  <p><strong>Scarce 2-volume 1981 Limited First Edition, First Printing of the elusive</strong> <em><strong>Codex Seraphinianus</strong></em> <strong>by Luigi Serafini</strong>, published in Milan, Italy by Franco Maria Ricci (FMR). Considered by many to be among the strangest and most vexing books in the world. Numbered <strong>856</strong> out of a limited printing of just <strong>4000</strong> copies and signed by the artist on the colophon page, this exceedingly hard-to-find set is printed on luxuriously textured Fabriano paper, resplendent in midnight-black silk bindings decorated with a profusion of gilt titling, encased in gorgeous black silk clamshell boxes; in fine condition overall with expected minor shelf wear.</p> <p>The <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em> was written and illustrated by Italian graphic designer and architect, Luigi Serafini during the mid- to late 1970's. The <em>Codex</em> is a masterpiece of fantasy painstakingly illustrating an encyclopedia, a travelogue or scientific study for an imaginary world in a parallel universe, with copious commentary in an incomprehensible language. It is written in a florid script, entirely invented and completely illegible, illustrated with intricate watercolor paintings. The language of the <em>Codex</em> has defied complete analysis by linguists for decades, although the small amount of progress that has been made seems to verify that the book does indeed contain meaningful text. The number system used for sequencing the pages, however, has reputedly been cracked by Bulgarian linguist <a href=""http://www.math.bas.bg/~iad/serafin.html"" target=""_blank"">Ivan Derzhanski</a>.</p>   <p>The <em>Codex</em> appears to be divided into eleven chapters, partitioned into two sections. The first section looks to describe the natural world, dealing with flora, fauna, and physics. The second deals with the humanities, the various aspects of human life: clothing, history, cuisine, architecture and so on. Each chapter seems to treat a general encyclopedic topic. The topics of each separate chapter appear to be as follows:</p> <ol><li>The first chapter describes many alien types of flora: strange flowers, trees that uproot themselves and migrate, etc.</li><li>The second chapter is devoted to the fauna of this alien world, depicting many animals that are surreal variations of the horse, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, birds, etc.</li><li>The third chapter deals with what seems to be a separate kingdom of odd bipedal creatures, apparently engineered for various purposes.</li><li>The fourth chapter deals with something that seems to be physics and chemistry, and is by far the most abstract and enigmatic.</li><li>The fifth chapter deals with bizarre machines and vehicles.</li><li>The sixth chapter explores the general humanities: biology, sexuality, various aboriginal peoples, and even shows examples of plant life and tools (such as pens and wrenches) grafted directly into the human body.</li><li>The seventh chapter is historical. It shows many people (some only vaguely human) of unknown significance, giving their times of birth and death. It also depicts many scenes of historical (and possibly religious) significance. Also included are examples of burial and funereal customs.</li><li>The eighth chapter depicts the history of the Codex's alien writing system.</li><li>The ninth chapter deals with food, dining practices, and clothing.</li><li>The tenth chapter describes bizarre games (including playing cards and board games) and athletic sports.</li><li>The eleventh chapter is devoted entirely to architecture.</li></ol> <p>Many view the <em>Codex</em> as a sort of an elaborate parody of the real world. The invented script of the book imitates Western-style writing systems (left-to-right writing in rows; an alphabet with uppercase and lowercase; probably a separate set of symbols for writing numerals) but is much more curvilinear reminding some of Semitic scripts. The writing seems to have been designed to appear, but not actually be, meaningful, like the <em>Voynich Manuscript</em>. Whilte subsequent lesser editions have been published and are expensive in their right, this 1981 first edition is extremely hard-to-find, with few known copies in libraries around the world.</p> <p>First released in this limited Italian edition in 1981, the book has periodically been published in France, Spain, and the United States. The author, an Italian artist, has never spoken about the origins of the book or the meaning of his language, but theorists surmise that it is inspired by the Borges story ""TlÃ¶n, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"" about a book from the (fictional) country of Uqbar that documents every aspect of an imaginary world called TlÃ¶n. Borges writes: ""The metaphysicians of TlÃ¶n are not looking for truth, nor even for an approximation of it; they are after a kind of amazement."" </p> <p>In September 2011 the esteemed British Museum mounted a special exhibition, ""Out of this World: But Not as You Know It,"" featuring many of the world's most influential science fiction treasures, among them the <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em>.</p> <p>A fascinating academic treatise, by Professor Peter Schwenger of Mt. Saint Vincent University in Halifax, discusses the Codex in some detail <a href=""http://faculty.msvu.ca/pschwenger/codex.htm"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.

Whimsically humanizing the work of the French master has thus devised a new kind of invention, a whole fantastic botanical world whose leaves, printed as illustrations contained in pockets on each page that can be removed and more closely examined, form an enchanted forest of trees, animation and mutant plantsâa celebration of the eternal vitality of natural history.</p> <p>This large-format volume has a brown canvas cover on which is reproduced the original covers of <em>Storie Naturali</em> as published by BUR in 1959, with the lenticular image of a fox (in French: <em>renard</em>). The pages are of the highest quality paper, the lyrical text, in Italian, is from Renard's original book. This fascinating book contains 20 pockets that contain the beautifully imagined herbarium leaves.</p> <p>At 262 pages with pockets and inserts, <em>Storie Naturali</em> is a limited edition of 660 copies numbered and signed by the artist, of which this copy is #147. Published by Biblioteca Universale Rizzoli, Milan, in 2009.</p> <h3>Biography <br/></h3> <p><strong>Luigi Serafini</strong> (born on 4 August, 1949 in Rome, Italy) is an Italian artist, architect and designer. Graduated with a BA in Architecture at the Politecnico in Milan, Serafini started working as a designer, in cooperation with Gruppo Memphis, headed by architect Ettore Sottsass. He also worked for Italian television and several movie production companies, among them Federico Fellini's La Voce della Luna, in addition to stage, light and costume designing for the great La Scala theater in Milan. He has created scenery, lighting and costumes for the ballet The Jazz Calendar by Frederick Ashton at Teatro alla Scala and worked also for the Piccolo Teatro di Milano.</p> <p>Among his most significant works the renowned <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em>âan illustrated encyclopedia of imaginary vegetal and animal species in an undecipherable languageâpublished in 1981 by Franco Maria Ricci and reprinted by Rizzoli in 2006 should be mentioned. The <em>Codex Seraphinianus</em> was originally released in a limited edition of 4,000 artfully-bound copies in 1981. It has been later republished on four occasions, first in a 1983 English language edition; then in English, Spanish and French editions in the 1990s, each again limited to 5,000 copies; and finally in a more widely printed 2006 edition. In 1984 he illustrated <em>Pulcinellopedia (piccola)</em> by P. Cetrulo (published by Longanesi), with a suite of pencil drawings focusing on the Neapolitan masque of Pulcinella. He also published collections of short stories for Bompiani, Archinto, Fandango and several magazines. </p> <p>In 2003 he completed a polychrome bronze sculpture <em>Carpe Diem</em> and some bas-reliefs for one of the Naples subway stations (Mater Dei). In May 2007, he held an ""ontological exhibition"" Luna Pac at P.A.C. (the Pavilion of Contemporary Art) in Milan. In the same year the P.A.C. has paid homage to the artistic universe of Luigi Serafini by showing the 100 original plates of the Codex. Serafini has been a Banff Center visiting artist and has exhibited at the Fondazione Mudima in Milan, the XIII Quadriennale, the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome, the Futurarium and the Didael gallery. In July 2008 he completed a polychrome installation BalanÃ§oires sans FrontiÃ¨res (Altalene senza Frontiere) in Castasegna, Switzerland. In 2009 Serafini illustrated <em>Storie Naturali</em>, a reinterpretation of <em>Histoires naturelles</em> (Natural Histories) by Jules Renard, published by Rizzoli in a signed, limited edition of 660 copies.</p> <p>Roland Barthes, Italo Calvino, Federico Fellini, Leonardo Sciascia, Giorgio Manganelli, Giorgio Soavi, Federico Zeri, Achille Bonito Oliva, Douglas Hofstadter, Philippe DecoufflÃ© and Vittorio Sgarbi have engaged in the analisys of Serafini's works. Calvino has epitomized the mechanisms and the rhetorical devices in his oeuvre: ""...like in Ovidio's Metamorphoses, Serafini believes in the contiguity and permeability of every territory of the existing: the anatomic and the mechanic elements exchange their morphologies, the human and the vegetal reigns find their mutual completeness...the wild and the metropolitan, the writing and the living.""</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Accompanied by Letter of Authenticity by James Spence Authentication LLC.</p> <p><strong>JAMES BYRON DEAN</strong> (1931-1955) was a two-time Oscar-nominated American film actor. Dean's status as a cultural icon is best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, in which he starred as troubled stereotypical high school rebel Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his star power were as the awkward loner Cal Trask in <em>East of Eden</em>, and as the surly farmer Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>. His enduring fame and popularity rests on only three films, his entire starring output. His death at the young age of 24 helped guarantee a legendary status. He was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only person to have two posthumous acting nominations.</p>   <p>In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for an actor to play the role of ""Cal Trask"" in screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel <em>East of Eden</em>. The book dealt with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California in the mid-1800s through the 1910s. However, the film chose to deal predominantly with the character of Cal Trask, who is essentially the rebel son of a pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey), and estranged mother, whom Cal discovers is a brothel-keeping madam (Jo Van Fleet). Elia Kazan said of Cal before casting, ""I wanted a Brando for the role."" Osborn suggested to Kazan that he consider Dean for the part. After introducing Dean to Steinbeck, and gaining his enthusiastic approval, Kazan set about putting the wheels in motion to cast the relatively unknown young actor in the role. On March 8, 1954, Dean left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>. Both characters are rebel loners and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving parental guidance from a father figure.</p>   <p>Much of Dean's performance in the film is completely unscripted, such as his dance in the bean field and his curling up and pulling his arms inside of his shirt on top of the train during his ride home from meeting his mother. The most famous improvisation during the film was when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000 (which was in reparation for his father's business loss). Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and, crying, embraced him. This cut and Massey's shocked reaction were kept in the film by Kazan.</p>   <p>At the 1955 Academy Awards, he received a posthumous Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination for this role, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Many American teens at the time of Dean's major movies identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>: the typical teenager, caught where no one, not even his peers, can understand him.

Original price of $12.95 printed on the back cover. Facsimile signature opposite copyright page.</p> <p>In 1976, Elton John's year-long world concert tour smashed attendance records from Earl's Court, London, to Madison Square Garden. Onstage, he was seen by millions; offstage, he lived in a private world known only to a few close friends. Now, with the help of gifted lyricist/poet Bernie Taupin and rock photographer David Nutter, Elton shares that very private world with the public, revealing for the first time an entire year of personal adventures and memories aboard his private plane, on the beaches of Barbados, at intimate backstage gatherings, and in quiet moments with friends (including some very famous faces).</p> <p>Never before has a rock performer authorized such a candid exploration of his private life; never before has the glitter - and lunacy - of the concert touring scene been recorded with such sensitive clarity.

There are two basic forms, including paintings on edges that have been fanned and edges that are closed: the first instance a book edge must be fanned to see the painting (as in our case) and in the second the painting is on the closed edge itself and thus should not be fanned. In order to view the painting, the leaves of the book must be fanned, exposing the edges of the pages and thereby the painting. For the fanned painting the watercolor is applied to the top or bottom margin (recto or verso) of the page/leaf and not to the actual ""fore""-edge itself.</p> <p>The actual artist's name is lost in history, but the scene is very clearly that of the Battle of Waterloo, around which the book's story takes place, and appears to be taken from the 1815 painting by William Sadler:</p> <p align=""center""><img alt=""Battle of Waterloo"" height=""187"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_FB785507-1517-6111-2887921D097BAA1D.jpg"" title=""Battle of Waterloo"" width=""410""/><br/><em>William Sadler II [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons </em></p> <p>Fine books like this were awarded at many schools throughout Britain to students who had exceled in a particular subject.

He began to study chemistry at the Cobianchi Institute in Intra, but broke off his studies there to enroll in the Bologna Academy of Fine Arts.Â  He finished his course there in 1915, winning a prize awarded by the Ministry of Education.</p>   <p>After fighting as a volunteer in the First World War, he met his future wife, Marie-ThÃ©rÃ¨se, on Lake Maggiore; she was from Paris, where they settled and he started his career as an artist. In Paris in 1920 he exhibited work at the Salon des Indipendants, attracting favorable reviews.Â  From then on he also took part regularly and with increasing success in the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Tuileries.</p>   <p>From 1920 he began to spend summer vacations in his wife's house in Lignorelles in Bourgogne. In Italy he held his first personal exhibition in 1923 in Pallanza, and was later to be invited to the Venice Bienniali, to the exhibitions of the Novecento italiano and the Quadriennali in Rome. In 1926 he founded in Paris the ""Group de sept"" (Group of Seven), gathering around him the major Italian artists living in the city: Campigli, De Pisis, De Chirico, Savinio, Paresce and Severini.</p>   <p>From 1927 Mario Tozzi enjoyed great success at a variety of international art exhibitions. In the years 1936-38 he also worked on frescoes, decorating the central hall of the general headquarters of the Militia in Rome.</p>   <p>In 1936 his health began to decline, so that he exhibited less and less and was often obliged to stop painting altogether.Â  Until 1944 he divided his time between Paris, Suna on Lake Maggiore in the summer, and Rome. In 1938 he worked on decorating the Court of Justice in Milan.</p>   <p>When his health improved he began to paint again, and in 1958 held a personal exhibition at the Galleria Annunciata in Milan, which marked what amounted to his ""resurrection"", and saw him once again take his place as a member of the circle of masters of the Novecento italiano.</p>   <p>In 1971 he moved to Paris, where his daughter lived, for good, following intimidation he had been subjected to in Suna by a vaguely defined ""Association for the defence of the painter"".</p>   <p>He died in 1979 in Saint-Jean-du-Gard in Bourgogne. In 1996, after the major exhibition held in Pallanza to mark the centenary of Mario Tozzi's birth, his brother Arnaldo donated 19 of his paintings to the Museo del Paesaggio.</p> <p><img alt=""Mario Tozzi - The Morning Toilet - 1922 painting"" height=""215"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomsm_EADD9532-3048-C0CE-55A6AF89B5CC7084.jpg"" title=""Mario Tozzi - The Morning Toilet - 1922 painting"" width=""150""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Inspired by his surroundings and from the tales of travelers he met, he created paintings that evoke emotion and contemplation. Van Ruisdael also used his imagination to create dramatic scenes and some of the most astonishing landscape art works ever produced. Though van Ruisdael was most famous for his landscape paintings, he also produced a small but impressive collection of etchings.</p> <p>Recognizing the growing appeal foreign landscapes had for art buyers, van Ruisdael set out for the rugged German border country around 1650 in search of inspiration. This etching, <em>The Great Beech</em>âone of only thirteen he completedâgrew out of that journey. Brimming with character, the exaggerated tree clinging tenaciously to the bank shows itself to be a survivor, as well as a symbol of transience amid the relentless cycle of growth and decay. Like the pair of dwarfed farmers in the background, we are meant to contemplate life's impermanence and the heroic power of untamed nature.</p> <p>Rooted in the Classical style, van Ruisdael laid the foundation for the Romantic style that came about in the late 18th century. His romantic mood is evident in his depiction of nature as he creates beautiful and tumultuous interpretations of the weather. Van Ruisdael portrayed images, objects and structures amidst the vast horizons that created a sense of escapism in their dreamlike portrayal. </p>  ",1650,995,0,FALSE,3688,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F16A28D2-1517-6111-287BCC5595BD05B8.jpg,

The story is about a young man who is coming of age and discovers his own homosexuality.<br/><br/><em>The City and the Pillar</em> is significant because it is recognized as the first post-World War II novel whose openly gay and well-adjusted protagonist is not killed off at the end of the story for defying social norms. It is also recognized as one of the ""definitive war-influenced gay novels,"" being one of the few books dealing directly with male homosexuality.

Gore set out to break the mold of novels that up until <em>The City and the Pillar</em> depicted homosexuals as transvestites, lonely bookish boys, or feminine.

To further this theme Vidal wrote the novel in plain, objective prose in order to convey and document reality.<br/><br/><strong>Gore Vidal</strong> (1925-2012) is an American novelist, screenwriter, playwright, essayist, short story writer, actor and politician.

After a successful career as a commercial illustrator, Warhol became famous worldwide for his work as a painter, avant-garde filmmaker, record producer, author, and public figure known for his membership in wildly diverse social circles that included bohemian street people, distinguished intellectuals, Hollywood celebrities and wealthy aristocrats.<br/><br/>Warhol has been the subject of numerous retrospective exhibitions, books, and feature and documentary films. He coined the expression ""15 minutes of fame.""<br/><br/>It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of iconic American products such as Campbell's Soup Cans from the Campbell Soup Company and Coca-Cola bottles, as well as paintings of celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Troy Donahue, and Elizabeth Taylor. He founded ""The Factory,"" his studio during these years, and gathered around himself a wide range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities. He began producing prints using the silkscreen method. His work became popular and controversial.<br/><br/>Among the imagery tackled by Warhol were dollar bills, celebrities and brand name products. He also used as imagery for his paintings newspaper headlines of photographs of mushroom clouds, electric chairs, and police dogs attacking civil rights protesters. Warhol also used Coca Cola bottles as subject matter for paintings. He had this to say about Coca Cola:</p> <blockquote>""What's great about this country is that America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca Cola, and you know that the President drinks Coca Cola, Liz Taylor drinks Coca Cola, and just think, you can drink Coca Cola, too. A coke is a coke and no amount of money can get you a better coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the cokes are the same and all the cokes are good.

A scant five months earlier Whitman had just published the seventh edition of his extraordinary verse collection <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, a landmark in the history of American literature. The seventh edition of his most popular work is generally recognized as the definitive edition of his poems, published in October 1881 by James R. Osgood and Company of Boston. In full:</p> <blockquote><p> <em>Camden, New Jersey<br/>        March 7, â82</em></p><p><em>        Dear Madam</em></p><p><em>        Returning here last evening I have mailed to you the two Volumes of my books. Would you please notify me soon as they reach you safely?</em></p><p><em>        Walt Whitman</em></p></blockquote> <p>According to <a href=""http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_89.html"" target=""_blank"">The Walt Whitman Archive</a>, the two-volume set was sent to Mrs. Coburn on March 7 following Whitman's two-week stay with George and Susan Stafford, the parents of Harry Stafford, a young man Whitman met and intimately befriended in the mid-1870s. Harry's parents were tenant farmers in Laurel Springs, outside of Glendale, near Camden, New Jersey. Harry invited Whitman to his family home, and Whitman immediately fell in love with the homestead and the intimate atmosphere. It reminded him of the Whitman family farm on Long Island that his parents had inherited from Whitman's paternal grandparents, Jesse and Hannah Whitman. After the initial visit to the Stafford farm, Whitman was to return several times over the following years, often staying for weeks at a time and paying for his lodging in order to help with family finances.</p> <p>While he was with the Staffords, Whitman found the time to work on <em>Specimen Days</em>, an autobiographical piece in which he, among other things, wanted to record his reactions to the war. In that memoir he turns from the horrors of war's destruction to the comforts and joys of his adopted home. The Stafford family serves as a counterpoint to the disruption of the Civil War. At the farm he also planned much of the 1881 edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. Whitman only stopped going to the farm when his friendship with Harry Stafford became strained, which made the visits uncomfortable. He later wrote that among the Staffords he felt both loved and able to love, and that they had in a real way saved his life after the horrors of the Civil War.</p> <p>According to <em>Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia</em> (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998) by J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings:    </p> <blockquote><p><em>""The Osgood edition is notable both for its legacy of clustering and because for the first time Whitman's book was being distributed by a mainstream publisher; Osgood's authors included James, Howells, and Twain. Whitman's book sold more than 1,500 copies before the publisher withdrew it after a district attorney objected to the sexual content and threatened to prosecute the company for selling obscene literature. The poet soon arranged to resume printing with Philadelphia publishersâfirst Rees Welsh, then David McKay when McKay acquired Leaves and other non-legal titles from Welsh, who specialized in law books...""</em></p></blockquote>   <p>This handwritten note has been exquisitely framed with the finest museum-quality conservation materials, accompanied by two photos of Whitmanâin youth and in old ageâand a brass identity plaque.

Choice condition.</p> <p><strong>WALT WHITMAN</strong> (1819-1892) was an American poet, essayist, journalist, and humanist. He was a part of the transition between Transcendentalism and realism, incorporating both views in his works. Whitman is among the most influential poets in the American canon, often called the father of free verse. His work was very controversial in its time, particularly his poetry collection <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, which was described as obscene for its overt sexuality.</p>   <p>Whitman claimed that after years of competing for ""the usual rewards"", he determined to become a poet. He first experimented with a variety of popular literary genres which appealed to the cultural tastes of the period. As early as 1850, he began writing what would become <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, a collection of poetry which he would continue editing and revising until his death. Whitman intended to write a distinctly American epic and used free verse with a cadence based on the Bible. At the end of June 1855, Whitman surprised his brothers with the already-printed first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>. George ""didn't think it worth reading"".</p>   <p>Whitman paid for the publication of the first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass </em>himself and had it printed at a local print shop during their breaks from commercial jobs. A total of 795 copies were printed, though the author's name was not given. Instead, facing the title page was an engraved portrait done by Samuel Hollyer. The book received its strongest praise from Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote a flattering five page letter to Whitman and spoke highly of the book to friends. The first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass </em>was widely distributed and stirred up significant interest, in part due to Emerson's approval, but was occasionally criticized for the seemingly ""obscene"" nature of the poetry. Geologist John Peter Lesley wrote to Emerson, calling the book ""trashy, profane &amp; obscene"" and the author ""a pretentious ass"". </p>   <p>In the months following the first edition of <em>Leaves of Grass</em>, critical responses began focusing more on the potentially offensive sexual themes. Though the second edition was already printed and bound, the publisher almost did not release it. In the end, the edition went to retail, with 20 additional poems, in August 1856. <em>Leaves of Grass </em>was revised and re-released in 1860 and again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In 1885 he came to New York and made all the pen-and-ink portraits for Scribner's ""Cyclopaedia of Painters and Paintings,"" as well as numerous others for periodicals. He drew the portraits for Appletons' ""Annual Cyclopaedia"" for 1886, 1887, and 1888.

 Oscar Wilde, Oscar,Wilde,Arts & Literature,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/oscar-wilde-de-profundis-facsimile-numbered-limited-edition/,De Profundis Numbered Limited Edition,"  <p><strong>An extraordinary limited edition facsimile of the original manuscript of Oscar Wilde's <em>De Profundis</em>âa long, harrowing letter written to his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas, whose dysfunctional relationship with his father Wilde blamed for his trial and imprisonment from 1895-97. Hand-numbered 279 of an edition of 495 published on the centenary of the death of Oscar Wilde by his grandson, Merlin Holland.<br/></strong></p> <p>""<strong>De Profundis</strong>"" is Latin for ""from the depths""; it comes from the first line of Psalm 130 of the penitential Psalms: <em>Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O Lord.</em> The writer E. V. Lucas (1868 - 1938) claimed to have suggested the title; Wilde had suggested ""Epistola: In Carcere et Vinculis,"" meaning <em>Letter: In Prison and in Chains</em>.</p> <p>During Wilde's incarceration in Reading Gaol, warden Major James Nelson allowed Wilde greater access to books and paper than he had under previous wardens; Wilde would later call Nelson ""the most Christlike man I ever met."" Wilde could not bring himself to write a play under these conditions; instead he concentrated on the more typical prison genre of the letter, and worked on it between December 1896 and March 1897.</p> <p>As Wilde's biographer Richard Ellmann remarked, the ""most important thing about <em>De Profundis</em> is that it is a love letter;"" despite its occasional arrogance and understandable lapses in structure, ""one of the greatest, and the longest, ever written."" It could be seen as a dramatic monologue from Wilde to Douglasâa long, public address in which Douglas's responses are assumed.</p> <p>As an autobiographical attempt to understand the nature of his own life and work, <em>De Profundis</em> also reflects brilliantly on art, love, forgiveness, the significance of Christ, and Wilde's own character and failings. Some times it mimics the humility of Christ; at others it returns to an older arrogance:</p> <blockquote><p> <em>""I was a man who stood in symbolic relations to the art and culture of my age. I had realised this for myself at the very dawn of my manhood, and had forced my age to realise it afterwards [...]""</em></p></blockquote> <p>Throughout, we see Wilde's gift for a pithy, insightful statement, but sobered by suffering:</p> <blockquote><p><em>    ""Most people live for love and admiration. But it is by love and admiration that we should live.""</em></p></blockquote> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the text is often savagely critical of Alfred Douglas, and accordingly, Wilde's executor Robert Ross and others feared being sued for libel if they published it in its entirety. The edition published in 1905 removed all reference to Douglas. In 1909, Ross gave this manuscript to the British Library (then the British Museum) on the condition that it was not made public for fifty years. In 1913, however, it was read in from as part of a libel case Douglas had brought against the writer Arthur Ransome, who had just published <em>Oscar Wilde: a Critical Study</em>. </p> <p>After Douglas's death Wilde's son Vyvyan Holland (1886-1967) published the full text of <em>De Profundis</em> (1949) from a transcript copy, but when Rupert Hart-Davis compared this version with the British Museum/British Library manuscript, he spotted inaccuracies and published a full version in 1962.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>[Portions of text Â© British Library Board as available under a Creative Commons Attribution License.]</p>  ",2000,499,0,FALSE,3789,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D1ECB8C9-1517-6111-284B316B21B7452D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D1EECB3E-1517-6111-28779280546CFB43.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/D1EF56C5-1517-6111-286260A294FEFBD1.jpg",Alfred Douglas

Otherwise a tight, clean, complete copy with crisp and clean pages.</p> <p>Frank Harris' well-regarded 1918 biography of Oscar Wilde cannot be read as a simple historical document. Harris frequently invents or embroiders, recasting conversations so that his part in them became more central, placing himself at events where he was not in fact present, and even recounting incidents that never happened at all. However, it would not be fair to discount it entirely. At the time it was written Wilde was regarded as a pariah, yet Harris never swerved from his view that Wilde's treatment by the public, press and the judiciary had been a monstrous injustice.   </p> <p>The undoubted friendship between Oscar Wilde and Frank Harris is one of the stranger aspects of Harris' life. They were so unlike: Wilde the wit and aesthete, the darling of fashionable London, Harris playing the loud American, lecturing all within earshot about whatever they would least like to hear. And the fact they were both great talkers would, one might suppose, have led rather to rivalry than friendship. But as outsiders, exiles, perhaps there was a deeper common bond. In both, too, there was an idealistic streak, in Oscar's case it was beauty that he saw as the key to life, while Harris was an atheistic humanist who yet loved Jesus; if they failed to live up to their ideals then is that not the tragedy of us all?</p>   <p>In the end, Harris was generous to Wilde both in life and to his memory. He did not paint Wilde as a heroic figure, but Wilde was only intermittently heroic. If he did not convey much of Wilde's wit, that is documented well enough elsewhere, in Wilde's own works and the oft-told anecdotes of others.</p>   <p><em><strong>In Frank Harris's own words:</strong></em></p> <blockquote><p>""There are special reasons...why I should handle this story. Oscar Wilde was a friend of mine for many years: I could not help prizing him to the very end: he was always to me a charming, soul-animating influence. He was dreadfully punished by men utterly his inferiors: ruined, outlawed, persecuted till Death itself came as a deliverance. His sentence impeaches his judges. The whole story is charged with tragic pathos and unforgettable lessons. I have waited for more than ten years hoping that some one would write about him in this spirit and leave me free to do other things, but nothing such as I propose has yet appeared.""</p></blockquote> <p>Interestingly, Lord Alfred Douglas (""Bosie"", as Wilde called him) refuted many of the contentions in Harris's book in a letter dated December 27, 1929, which was later sold at auction by Sotheby's. Douglas writes:</p> <blockquote><p>""...I do not wish to add anything to what I have already said...because the complete <em>malentendu</em> between us is so great that the only thing to remove it is for you to read my book...Harris's book is a tissue of the most malicious &amp; cunningly devised lies ever invented by a malignant man (or rather two men for Ross helped him to distort the story)...I denied the immoral relations...simply because the conventions of English Society demanded it; and because I was thinking of the feelings of my mother my wife &amp; my son. I was told that if I admitted the truth I would be for ever ruined &amp; ostracised...In my present book I have admitted everything...the truth of my story...is now accepted by everyone, even by my enemies...I think you might search the annals of England in vain to find anyone who has <em>ever</em> admitted this particular vice before I did it myself in my Autobiography. As it happens it has done me no harm at all socially...""</p></blockquote>  ",1918,1200,0,FALSE,3406,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F60EC9E7-1517-6111-28C06883A87E7F16.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F612F2D0-1517-6111-286548400050250D.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F61385C9-1517-6111-28510BE12F0E4289.jpg",

Sussex, England: January 12, 1933, by the English author, poet and intimate companion of Irish poet and aesthete Oscar Wilde. </strong>Single sheet of personal stationery, 8"" x 10"" (20 x 25 cm) page written in manuscript on recto and verso. Accompanied by an envelope addressed in Douglasâ same cursive to âMiss Barbara Cassel, 365 Crown Street, Brooklyn, New York. U.S.A.,â with a Brighton &amp; Hove postmark dated January 12, 1933, stamp excised. Written 33 years after Wilde's death, this wonderful letter reads, in full:</p> <blockquote><p><strong><em>Dear Miss Barbara Cassel,</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>In reply to your letter, I have really said all I have to say about Oscar Wilde in my ""</em>Autobiography<em>"" (published in America as ""</em>My Friendship with Oscar Wilde<em>"") and I am only writing these few lines so as not to leave your letter unanswered.</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Yours sincerely, <br/>Alfred Douglas</em></strong></p></blockquote> <p>In an elaborate full page postscript Lord Douglas continues:</p> <blockquote><p><strong><em>P.S. I have just finished a new book on Shakespeare's Sonnets which will be published early in March by Martin Secker in London. It is called ""</em>The True History of Shakespeare's Sonnets<em>."" I have quoted a good deal from Oscar Wilde's story ""</em>The Story of Mr. W. H.<em>"" [actually he meant ""</em>The Portrait of Mr. W. H.""<em>] which deals with the same subject. I expect I shall be having an American edition of the book but I have not yet had the time to arrange this.</em></strong></p></blockquote> <p>Two months later Lord Douglas writes again to Miss Cassel in an exceptional letter offered by our colleagues at <a href=""http://www.baumanrarebooks.com/rare-books/douglas-lord-alfred-wilde-oscar/autograph-letter-signed/66978.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Bauman Books</a>, saying in part: </p> <blockquote><p><em>""In reply to your letter, Oscar Wilde's novel </em>The Picture of Dorian Gray<em>, was written about a year before I first met him, consequently he could not possibly have drawn his portrait from me. The photograph of myself in the American edition of my </em>Autobiography<em>, to which you refer as ""a photograph of yourself when you were a boy of nineteen,"" was as a matter of fact taken when I was twenty three, as you will see if you look at it again. My personal appearance did not change appreciably from the time I was 18 till I was well over 30. In that respect perhaps I resembled Dorian Gray. I hope I did not resemble him in any other way!...""  </em></p></blockquote> <p style=""font-size: 1em""><strong>LORD ALFRED BRUCE DOUGLAS</strong> (1870-1945), was a British writer who first came to prominence in the 1890s as the young intimate companion of Oscar Wilde.

Edited and with Notes by John Rothenstein. New York: Coward-McCann, Inc., 1930. First Edition. Limited Edition. Personally owned by famed playwright Eugene O'Neill.Â </strong>   <p>A lovely First Edition copy of this scarce and fascinating book. Irish author Oscar Wilde (1854-1900) was known mainly for his plays, such as <em>The Importance of Being Earnest</em> and for his only novel, <em>The Picture of Dorian Gray</em>. This book is in a Limited Edition of 515 copies of which 500 were for sale. </p>   <p>The most notable element of this book is the bookplate on the front inside cover with the printed signed inscription ""<strong>Carlotta, Eugene O'Neill</strong>"". This book was owned by the famous playwright/author and his third wife Carlotta, evidenced by his personal bookplate inside the front cover. Published 80 years ago, this slim volume, just 39 pages, is now long out of print and quite scarce, but it is made much more valuable as a fascinating association copyâa book by one of the greatest British playwrights of his era and owned by one of the greatest American playwrights of the next era. From the Editor:</p>   <blockquote><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE</em></p><p><em>The sixteen letters that follow are all that remain of a series written by Oscar Wilde to William Rothenstein between 1891 and 1900.</em></p><p><em>They are now published, for the first time, in deference to the often-expressed wishes of several of the writer's surviving friends. One of them, number VIII, I remember hearing M. AndrÃ© Gide describe as the most important unpublished Wilde letter he knew of.

It was inscribed and signed on the Title Page in person to its current owner, in Seattle, Washington, January 1998.</p> <p>In her first novel, <em>Lincoln's Dreams</em>, Connie Willis tackled the incomprehensible tragedy that was the U.S. Civil War. Next, in the award-winning <em>Doomsday Book</em>, she brought the long-ago horror of the Black Death to life for a present-day audience. No simple disaster story, this book gives readers time to fall in love with its many heroes and even to sympathize with its villains. When disease begins its sweep through the novel's cast, the effect is devastating and strangely intimate.</p> <p>A meticulous researcher who always imbues her time-travel pieces with a rich level of historical detail, Willis obscures the precise nature of what is happening to her characters in the early sections of the book. They are left to chase a trail of crumb-sized clues to the truth. As answers emerge, the particular brilliance of <em>Doomsday Bookâ</em>its parallel storylinesâbecomes obvious. Even as Kivrin realizes she is in the midst of the plague, the influenza outbreak at home is killing people at the university. Both epidemics play out in detail, showing how far medical technology has developed in the centuries between 1348 and the present...and how little human nature has changed over the same period. The helplessness of the medieval villagers against the plague is contrasted with a frantic modern effort to fight the influenza. The results are humbling.</p> <p>Mankind's physical vulnerability in the face of infectious disease is hardly the only theme of this novel, whose true subject matter is the human capacity for love, courage and faith. Kivrin cannot save the plague victims from death, but-of course-defeating death was never a likely outcome. Time and again, Willis reminds readers that nobody escapes death, that every century (whatever its time-travel rating) has a 100 percent death rate for its contemporaries. What Kivrin does save the medieval villagers from is arguably more important: indignity, fear and despair. And when she is in her turn rescued, the experience is unforgettably moving.</p> <p><strong>CONNIE WILLIS</strong> (1945) is one of the most honored American science fiction writers today, notably for her works of the 1980s and 1990s. She has won, among other awards, nine Hugo Awards and six Nebula Awards. Willis most recently won a Hugo Award for <em>Inside Job</em> (August 2006). </p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Your Cat Is Dead</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Salvatore Mineo, Jr.</strong> (1939-1976), better known as Sal Mineo, was an American film and theatre actor, best known for his performance opposite <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a> in the film <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>.</p>   <p>In 1955âthe year he wrote this letterâhe appeared in <em>three</em> films: <strong><em>Six Bridges to Cross</em></strong> with Tony Curtis; <strong><em>The Private War of Major Benson</em></strong> with Charleton Heston; and his first big breakthrough in <strong><em>Rebel Without A Cause</em></strong>, in which he played John ""Plato"" Crawford, the sensitive teenager smitten with Jim Stark (played by <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a>). His performance resulted in an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, and his popularity quickly developed. Mineo's biographer, Paul Jeffers, recounted that Mineo received thousands of fan letters from young female admirers, was mobbed by them at public appearances and further wrote, ""He dated the most beautiful women in Hollywood and New York.""</p>   <p>Mineo played a Mexican boy in <em>Giant</em> (1956), again with James Dean along with Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. But many of his subsequent roles were variations of his role in <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, and he was typecast as a troubled teen.</p>   <p>In 1957, Mineo made a brief foray into music by recording a handful of songs and an album. Two of his singles reached the Top 40 pop charts. The more popular of the two, ""<em>Start Movin' (In My Direction)</em>"", reached #9 on Billboard's pop chart. He also starred as famed drummer Gene Krupa in the movie <em>The Gene Krupa Story</em>, co-starring Susan Kohner, James Darren, and Susan Oliver, and directed by Don Weis.</p>   <p>By the early 1960s, he was becoming too old to play the type of role that had made him famous and was not considered appropriate for leading roles. He auditioned for David Lean's film <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> but was not hired. Mineo was baffled by his sudden loss of popularity, later saying ""One minute it seemed I had more movie offers than I could handle, the next, no one wanted me.""</p>   <p>In the late 1960s, Sal realized he also was attracted to men and was probably the first major actor in Hollywood to publicly admit his homosexual lifestyle, and was a pioneer in paving the way for future generations of gay actors. </p>   <p>By 1976 Mineo's career had begun to turn around. Playing the role of a gay burglar in a San Francisco run of the stage comedy <em>P.S. Your Cat Is Dead</em>, he received substantial publicity from many positive reviews and moved on to Los Angeles with the play. Arriving home after a rehearsal on February 12, 1976, Mineo was stabbed to death in the alley behind his West Hollywood apartment building. He was 37 years old.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Decades after Adams' untimely death from a prescription drug overdose at the age of 36 his widely publicized friendships with James Dean and Elvis Presley would stir speculation about both his private life and the circumstances of his death. In a synopsis for Adams' last film in Allmovie reviewer Dan Pavlides wrote, ""Plagued by personal excesses, he will be remembered just as much for what he could have done in cinema as what he left behind.""</p>   <p>In 1959 Adams starred in the ABC television series <em>The Rebel</em> playing the character Johnny Yuma, a wandering, ex-Confederate, journal-keeping, sawed-off shotgun toting ""trouble-shooter"" in the old American west. He is credited as a co-creator of <em>The Rebel</em> but had no role in writing the pilot or any of the series' episodes. Adams had asked his friend Andrew J. Fenady to write the pilot as a starring vehicle for him. The series' only recurring character, publicized as a ""Reconstruction beatnik"", was played by Adams. He reportedly consulted with John Wayne for tips on how to play the role. Adams wanted Elvis Presley to sing the theme song for <em>The Rebel</em> but the show's producer wanted Johnny Cash, who made it a hit. Guest stars appearing on the series during its two year run included Dan Blocker, Johnny Cash, Leonard Nimoy, Tex Ritter and Robert Vaughn. 76 half-hour episodes were filmed before the series was cancelled in 1961.

Only a light crease through the ""D"" affects the signature. Accompanied by Letter of Authenticity by James Spence Authentication LLC.</p> <p><strong>JAMES BYRON DEAN</strong> (1931-1955) was a two-time Oscar-nominated American film actor. Dean's status as a cultural icon is best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, in which he starred as troubled stereotypical high school rebel Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his star power were as the awkward loner Cal Trask in <em>East of Eden</em>, and as the surly farmer Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>. His enduring fame and popularity rests on only three films, his entire starring output. His death at the young age of 24 helped guarantee a legendary status. He was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only person to have two posthumous acting nominations.</p>   <p>In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for an actor to play the role of ""Cal Trask"" in screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel <em>East of Eden</em>. The book dealt with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California in the mid-1800s through the 1910s. However, the film chose to deal predominantly with the character of Cal Trask, who is essentially the rebel son of a pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey), and estranged mother, whom Cal discovers is a brothel-keeping madam (Jo Van Fleet). Elia Kazan said of Cal before casting, ""I wanted a Brando for the role."" Osborn suggested to Kazan that he consider Dean for the part. After introducing Dean to Steinbeck, and gaining his enthusiastic approval, Kazan set about putting the wheels in motion to cast the relatively unknown young actor in the role. On March 8, 1954, Dean left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>. Both characters are rebel loners and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving parental guidance from a father figure.</p>   <p>Much of Dean's performance in the film is completely unscripted, such as his dance in the bean field and his curling up and pulling his arms inside of his shirt on top of the train during his ride home from meeting his mother. The most famous improvisation during the film was when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000 (which was in reparation for his father's business loss). Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and, crying, embraced him. This cut and Massey's shocked reaction were kept in the film by Kazan.</p>   <p>At the 1955 Academy Awards, he received a posthumous Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination for this role, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Many American teens at the time of Dean's major movies identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>: the typical teenager, caught where no one, not even his peers, can understand him.

According to author and Harvard professor Marjorie Garber, this quality is ""the undefinable extra something that makes a star."" Dean's iconic appeal has been attributed to the public's need for someone to stand up for the disenfranchised young of the era, and to the air of androgyny that he projected onscreen.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

His stage and subsequent film career spanned a total of seventy-six years, during which he made thirty-one musical films. He is particularly associated with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/ginger-rogers-autograph-signed-signature-fred-astaire"" target=""_blank"">Ginger Rogers</a>, with whom he made ten films.</p>   <p>Fred Astaire is generally acknowledged to have been one of the most influential dancers in the history of film and television musicals. He was named the fifth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the American Film Institute.</p>   <p>Astaire was a virtuoso dancer, able to convey light-hearted abandon or deep emotion when called for. His technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing. Long after the photography for the solo dance number ""I Want To Be A Dancin' Man"" was completed for the 1952 feature <em>The Belle Of New York</em>, it was decided that Astaire's humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was re-shot. The 1994 documentary <em>That's Entertainment! III</em> shows the two performances side-by-side in split screen. Frame for frame, the two performances are absolutely identical, down to the subtlest gesture.</p>   <p>Astaire's execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality and precision. He drew from a variety of influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle, to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance, and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach his ""outlaw style"", an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

She ranks #14 on the list of AFI's 100 Years... 100 Stars.<br/><br/>During her long career, she made a total of 73 films, and is noted for her role as Fred Astaire's romantic interest and dancing partner in a series of ten Hollywood musical films that revolutionized the genre. She also achieved success in a variety of film roles, and won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in <em>Kitty Foyle</em> (1940).<br/><br/>Rogers was most famous for her partnership with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/fred-astaire-autograph-signature-typed-letter-signed-john-grissim"" target=""_blank"">Fred Astaire</a>. Together, from 1933 to 1939, they made nine musical films at RKO: <em>Flying Down to Rio</em> (1933), <em>The Gay Divorcee</em> (1934), <em>Roberta</em> (1935), <em>Top Hat</em> (1935), <em>Follow the Fleet</em> (1936), <em>Swing Time</em> (1936), <em>Shall We Dance</em> (1937), <em>Carefree</em> (1938), and <em>The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle</em> (1939), and a tenth film, <em>The Barkleys of Broadway</em> (1949), was made later at MGM, and in so doing, revolutionized the Hollywood musical, introducing dance routines of unprecedented elegance and virtuosity, set to songs specially composed for them by the greatest popular song composers of the day.

He was known for brooding, sensitive, working-class character roles, and received four Academy Award nominations during his career. Appearing on Broadway at the age of thirteen, Clift achieved success on the stage and starred there for ten years before moving to Hollywood, debuting in 1948's <em>Red River</em> opposite John Wayne.<br/><br/>In 1958 he turned down what became Dean Martin's role in <em>Rio Bravo</em>, which would have reunited him with Wayne. This may have been because of the tension between the two actors: Wayne would refuse to socialize with Clift between takes during the filming of <em>Red River</em> because of Wayne's disapproval of Clift's sexuality.<br/><br/>Clift was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor that same year for <em>The Search</em>. His sensitive and intense quality gave him an image as the kind of a person to be taken care of. His love scenes with Elizabeth Taylor in <em>A Place in the Sun</em> (1951) represented a new standard for romance in cinema. His roles in <em>A Place in the Sun</em>, the 1953 classic <em>From Here to Eternity</em> and <em>The Young Lions</em> (1958) were career milestones.<br/><br/>Clift and Marlon Brando, who was also born in Omaha, had reputations as Hollywood rivals because of their rapid rise to stardom and similar acting styles. Clift was one of James Dean's idols and he would sometimes call him ""just to hear his voice.""</p> <p>Clift reportedly turned down the starring roles in <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> and <em>East of Eden</em>. At one point he was receiving so many offers of roles that scripts literally filled up his home. Friends had to squeeze past stacks of them in order to walk up the stairs.<br/><br/>On May 12, 1956, while filming <em>Raintree County</em>, he smashed his car into a telephone pole after leaving a party at the home of his <em>Raintree County</em> co-star Elizabeth Taylor and her then-husband Michael Wilding. Alerted by friend Kevin McCarthy, who witnessed the accident, Taylor raced to Clift's side and kept him from choking to death by removing two of his teeth, which had become lodged in his throat. Clift suffered spinal damage. Most of the injuries on his face were apparently below the skin; doctors elected not to do plastic surgery. In a filmed interview, he later described how his nose could be snapped back into place. After a long recovery, he returned to the set to finish the film. Against the movie studio's worries over profits, Clift rightly predicted the film would do well, if only because moviegoers would flock to see the difference in his facial appearance before and after the accident. The pain of the accident led him to rely on alcohol and pills for relief, as he had done after an earlier bout with dysentery (thanks to a film shot in Mexico) left him with chronic intestinal problems. As a result, Clift's health and looks deteriorated considerably. Taylor and Clift remained close friends until his death.<br/><br/>On Monday, July 22, 1966, Clift spent most of the day in his bedroom in his New York City townhouse. He and his live-in personal secretary, Lorenzo James, had not spoken much all day. At 1 a.m., Lorenzo went up to say goodnight. <em>The Misfits</em> was airing on TV that night, and Lorenzo asked Clift if he wanted to watch it. ""Absolutely NOT!"" was the reply. Those were his last words to anyone. At 6 a.m. the next morning, Lorenzo went to wake him, but found the bedroom door locked. Unable to break it down, he ran down to the garden and climbed a ladder to the bedroom window. When he got inside, he found Clift dead. He was undressed, lying on his back in bed, with glasses on and fists clenched. He was 45 years old.<br/><br/>Â <br/><br/>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Blackstone began his career as a magician in his teens and was popular through World War II as a USO entertainer. He was often billed as The Great Blackstone. His son Harry Blackstone, Jr. also became a famous magician.</p>   <p>Blackstone was in the mode of courtly elegant predecessor magicians like Howard Thurston and Harry Kellar. He often wore white tie and tails when performing, and he traveled with large illusions and a sizable cast of uniformed male and female assistants. For a number of years he toured in the Midwest, often performing throughout the day between film showings. Blackstone remained silent during much of his big stage show, which was presented to the accompaniment of a pit orchestra and such lively tunes of the time as ""Who,"" ""I Know That You Know,"" and ""Chinatown.""</p>   <p>Among his especially effective illusions was one in which a woman lying on a couch and covered with a gossamer shroud appeared to float high in the air and then vanish, as Blackstone pulled off the covering. In another illusion, a woman stepped into a cabinet in front of many bright, clear, tubular incandescent light bulbs. When the magician suddenly pushed the perforated front of the cabinet backward, she seemed to be pierced appeared through the holes in the font of the box (to the accompaniment of her blood-curdling scream). The cabinet was then revolved so that the audience seemed to see the lady impaled by the blinding filaments.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Lasting 14 seasons, it is among the longest running Western television series (behind <em>Gunsmoke</em>) and continues to air in syndication worldwide.</p>   <p><em>Bonanza</em> got its name from the Comstock Lode which was ""an exceptionally large and rich mineral deposit"" of silver. Virginia City was founded directly over the lode which was mined for 19 years. <em>Ponderosa</em> was an alternative title of the series, used for the broadcast of syndicated reruns while Bonanza was in first-run on NBC, and became the name of the 600,000 acre Sierra Nevada ranch featured in the series.</p>   <p>In 1959, the series aired on Saturday evenings opposite, <em>The Perry Como Hour</em>. <em>Bonanza </em>was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in color. RCA owned NBC (and the series) and wanted to use it to spur sales of color television sets. However, the Saturday night ratings were dismal and <em>Bonanza </em>was soon targeted for cancellation. Given one last chance, it was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 PM. The new time slot caused the series to soar, and it eventually reached number one by the mid-'60s; by 1970, it had become the first series to ever wind up in the Top Five for nine consecutive seasons (a record which would stand for decades) and thus established itself as the single biggest hit TV series of the 1960s; it remained high on the Nielsen ratings until 1971, when it finally fell out of the top ten. </p> <p>Â <img alt=""Bonanza Cast"" height=""330"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/6B483853-3048-C0CE-557F792E339C16CA.jpg"" title=""Bonanza Cast"" width=""310""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked him the greatest male star.<br/><br/>After trying various jobs, Bogart began acting in 1921 and became a regular in Broadway productions in the 1920s and 1930s. When the stock market crash of 1929 reduced the demand for plays, Bogart also turned to film. His first great success was as Duke Mantee in <em>The Petrified Forest</em>, and this led to a period of typecasting as a gangster in B-movies. His breakthrough came in 1941, with <em>High Sierra</em> and <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>. The next year, his performance in <em>Casablanca</em> raised him to the peak of his profession and at the same time, cemented his trademark film persona, that of the hard-boiled cynic who ultimately shows his noble side. Other successes followed, including <em>To Have and Have Not</em> (1944), <em>The Big Sleep</em> (1946), and <em>Key Largo</em> (1948), with his wife Lauren Bacall; <em>The Treasure of the Sierra Madre</em> (1948); <em>The African Queen</em> (1951), for which he won his only Academy Award; and <em>The Caine Mutiny</em> (1954). During a film career of almost thirty years, he appeared in 75 feature films.<br/><br/>At the time of his death from cancer in 1957, Bogart was one of the most respected figures in American cinema. Since his death, his persona and film performances have been considered as having a lasting impact and have led to him being described as a cultural icon. In 1997, <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> magazine named him the number one movie legend of all time. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Signed boldly by Bacall in person. Accompanied by J. Spence COA.<br/></strong></p> <p><strong>LAUREN BACALL</strong> (1924-) is an American film and stage actress and model. Known for her husky voice and sultry looks, she became a fashion icon in the 1940s and has continued acting to the present day.</p> <p>Bacall studied acting for 13 years, taking lessons at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. During this time, she became a theatre usher and worked as a fashion model. As Betty Bacall, she made her acting debut on Broadway in 1942, in <em>Johnny 2 X 4</em>. Howard Hawks's wife Nancy spotted her on the March 1943 cover of Harper's Bazaar and urged Hawks to have her take a screen test for <em>To Have and Have Not</em>. Hawks invited Bacall to Hollywood for the audition. He signed her up to a seven-year personal contract, brought her to Hollywood, gave her $100 a week, and began to manage her career.

Signed and inscribed in blue ballpoint ""To Clay Wilson from The Scarecrow of Oz, Ray Bolger"". In fine condition, with a few minor creases.</strong></p> <p><strong>RAY BOLGER</strong> (1904-1987) was an American entertainer of stage and screen, best known for his portrayal of the Scarecrow and Kansas farm worker in the 1939 film, <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>   <p>Bolger's film career began when he signed a contract with MGM in 1936. His best-known film appearance prior to The Wizard of Oz was <em>The Great Ziegfeld</em> (1936), in which he portrayed himself. But he also appeared in <em>Sweethearts</em>, (1938) the first MGM film in Technicolor, starring Nelson Eddy, Jeanette MacDonald, and Bolger's future Oz co-star, Frank Morgan, as well as the 1937 Eleanor Powell vehicle <em>Rosalie</em>, which also starred Eddy and Morgan.</p>   <p>Bolger's studio contract stipulated that he would play any part the studio chose; however, he was unhappy when he was cast as the Tin Man. The Scarecrow part had already been assigned to another lean and limber dancing studio contract player, Buddy Ebsen.</p>   <p>In time, the roles were switched. While Bolger was pleased with his role as the Scarecrow, Ebsen was struck ill by the powdered aluminum make-up used to complete the Tin Man costume. The powdered aluminum badly coated Ebsen's lungs, leaving him near death. Ironically, Ebsen would outlive all the principal players of Oz. Ebsen's illness paved the way for the Tin Man role to be filled by Jack Haley.</p>   <p>Bolger's performance in <em>Oz</em> was a tour de force, and he displayed the full range of his physical, comedic, and dramatic talents playing the character searching for the brain that he always had. The Scarecrow's sympathy for Dorothy Gale's plight, his cleverness and bravery in rescuing her from the Wicked Witch of the West (played by Margaret Hamilton) and his deep affection for her shone through, endearing the character - and Bolger - in the public mind forever. Whenever queried as to whether he received any residuals from telecasts of the 1939 classic, Bolger would reply: ""No, just immortality. I'll settle for that.""</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Lasting 14 seasons, it is among the longest running Western television series (behind <em>Gunsmoke</em>) and continues to air in syndication worldwide.</p>   <p><em>Bonanza</em> got its name from the Comstock Lode which was ""an exceptionally large and rich mineral deposit"" of silver. Virginia City was founded directly over the lode which was mined for 19 years. <em>Ponderosa</em> was an alternative title of the series, used for the broadcast of syndicated reruns while Bonanza was in first-run on NBC, and became the name of the 600,000 acre Sierra Nevada ranch featured in the series.</p>   <p>In 1959, the series aired on Saturday evenings opposite, <em>The Perry Como Hour</em>. <em>Bonanza </em>was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in color. RCA owned NBC (and the series) and wanted to use it to spur sales of color television sets. However, the Saturday night ratings were dismal and <em>Bonanza </em>was soon targeted for cancellation. Given one last chance, it was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 PM. The new time slot caused the series to soar, and it eventually reached number one by the mid-'60s; by 1970, it had become the first series to ever wind up in the Top Five for nine consecutive seasons (a record which would stand for decades) and thus established itself as the single biggest hit TV series of the 1960s; it remained high on the Nielsen ratings until 1971, when it finally fell out of the top ten. </p> <p>Â <img alt=""Bonanza Cast"" height=""330"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/6B483853-3048-C0CE-557F792E339C16CA.jpg"" title=""Bonanza Cast"" width=""310""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Thirteen years after her death, she was portrayed on the Broadway stage by Barbra Streisand in the musical <em>Funny Girl</em>. The musical was made into a film in 1968. </p> <p>To Florenz Ziegfeld, entrepreneur of the sensual and creator of <em>The Ziegfeld Follies</em>, a comedian was someone who kept audiences distracted while his beloved chorus girls were changing costumes. Still, he would have only the bestâWill Rogers, WC Fields, Bert Williamsâand when he heard Fanny sing ""Sadie Salome, Go Home"" with a Yiddish accent in a Broadway burlesque, he knew that with her onstage his girls could take their time.</p>   <p>Fanny Brice was almost 19. She had been born on the Lower East Side and brought up above a saloon in Newark. She was tall and skinnyâa drawback in 1910, when chorus girls were at the very least statuesque. Skinny was funny. A comedian could capitalize on skinny.</p>   <p>The dream of every dancer, singer and comic in America was to make the <em>Follies</em>, so on the day Fanny arrived at work and was handed a telegram signed ""Florenz Ziegfeld"", she thought it was a joke. Still, what if... She didn't know that correspondence by telegram was Ziegfeld's style. On a hunch she telephoned. A moment later, she was whooping down Broadway.</p>   <p>After she signed the <em>Follies</em> contract, Fanny recovered enough to thank Ziegfeld in her most ladylike manner. She thanked the secretary. She thanked the doorman. Then she raced back down Broadway and stood outside the burlesque house all afternoon, grabbing people, showing them.</p>   <p>Many more contracts followed. For 20 years, Fanny sang her funny/sad songs and lampooned ballet dancers in graceful poses and society ladies from Sutton Place and Oyster Bay. And Ziegfeld smiled his tender smile and wrote out his generous checks, because the <em>Follies</em> wasn't the <em>Follies</em> without Fanny.</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In 1902 at the age of 10, he joined a troupe of circus tumblers known as the Five Marvellous Astons which toured the country on both the circus and vaudeville circuits. He gradually added comedy into his act and transformed himself into a comedian.In late 1928, he began making films. In 1929, he started making films for Warner Brothers. He quickly shot to stardom after appearing in the first all-color all-talking musical comedy <em>On with the Show</em> (1929). Warner Brothers quickly starred him in a number of lavish Technicolor musical comedies including: <em>Sally</em> (1929), <em>Hold Everything</em> (1930) and <em>Song of the West</em> (1930). By 1931, Joe E. Brown had become such a star that his name began to appear alone above the title of the movies in which he appeared. In 1933 and 1936, he managed to become one of the top ten earners in films. In 1937, he left Warner Brothers to work for David Loew. In 1938, he starred in <em>The Gladiator</em>, a loose film-adaptation of Philip Gordon Wylie's 1930 novel <em>Gladiator</em>, which influenced the creation of Superman. He gradually switched to making ""B"" pictures. During World War II, he spent a great deal of time entertaining troops, spending many nights meeting personally with servicemen at the famous USO Hollywood Canteen.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

In full:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>My darling  (my still) my husband,</strong></p><p><strong>Â Â Â Â  I wish I could tell of my love for you, of my fear, my delight, my pure animal pleasure of youâ(with you)âmy jealousy, my pride, my anger at you, at times.<br/>Â Â Â Â 	Most of all my love for you, and whatever love you can dole out to meâI wish I could write about it but I can't. I can only ""boil and bubble"" inside and hope you understand how I really feel.</strong></p><p><strong>Â Â Â Â  Anyway, I lust thee<br/>Â Â Â Â  Your (still) Wife</strong></p><p><strong>p.s.Â   O' Love, let us never take each other for granted again!<br/>p.p.s.Â   How about thatâ10 years!!</strong></p></blockquote> <p> This was a turbulent time for the couple, and they were to divorce just three months after Elizabeth wrote this letter expressing her devotion. Burton was known to be drinking heavily during filming, and according to press reports at the time, director Terence Young actually had to have the great English actor sitting or laying down for many of his linesâbecause he couldn't stand and deliver them. He was also having a well publicized affair with a waitress at a local bar the film crew frequented. </p> <p>Original photographs of Burton and Taylor togetherâand Burton with his mistressâare included with this lot, as are press reports, a photograph of the master suite the couple stayed in, and the actual lease document signed on their behalf by the film company representatives. Altogether rock solid provenance of a historic love letter between two of Hollywood's most tempestuous acting couples. To our knowledge no other love letter between Taylor and Burton has ever been offered on the market. </p>  ",1974,sold,1,FALSE,3669,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/B6D823FA-1517-6111-28993F81A3C7CF85.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/60988BC8-1517-6111-281BE75159B32B13.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/60992F99-1517-6111-287E0E380AD50D44.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/60A01E7A-1517-6111-28CC45F1EA6F4411.jpg",Richard Burton

He often portrayed impoverished campesinos or a peasant of pelado origin.

Charlie Chaplin once commented that he was the best comedian alive, and Moreno has even been referred to as the ""Charlie Chaplin of Mexico."" To audiences in the United States, he is best remembered as costarring with David Niven in <em>Around the World in 80 Days</em> (1956).</p> <p>As a pioneer of the cinema of Mexico, Moreno helped usher in its golden era. In addition to being a business leader, he also became involved in Mexico's tangled and often dangerous labor politics. Although he was himself politically conservative, his reputation as a spokesperson for the downtrodden gave his actions authenticity and became important in the early struggle against <em>charrismo</em>, the one-party government's practice of co-opting and controlling unions.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

Originally credited in films as Creighton Chaney, he was first credited as ""Lon Chaney, Jr."" in 1935.<br/><br/>It was only after his father's death that Chaney started acting in movies, beginning with an uncredited role in the 1932 film <em>Girl Crazy</em>. He appeared in films under his real name Creighton until 1935, when he began to be billed as ""Lon Chaney, Jr."" (and would appear as ""Lon Chaney"" later in his career). Chaney was asked to test for the role of Quasimodo for the 1939 remake of <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em>. The role went to Charles Laughton. In his final years, Lon would get a brief chance to play Quasimodo, and return to the roles of the Mummy, and the Wolfman on the 1960s television series ""<em>Route 66</em>"" with friends Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre. Lon first achieved stardom and critical acclaim in the 1939 feature film version of <em>Of Mice and Men</em>, in which he played Lennie Small.<br/><br/>In 1941, Chaney starred in the title role of <em>The Wolf Man</em> for Universal Pictures Co. Inc., a role which would typecast him for the rest of his life. He maintained a career at Universal horror movies over the next few years, replaying the Wolf Man in <em>Frankenstein</em> <em>Meets the Wolf Man, House of Frankenstein, House of Dracula, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,</em> Frankenstein's monster in <em>The Ghost of Frankenstein,</em> Kharis the mummy in <em>The Mummy's Tomb</em>, <em>The Mummy's Ghost</em> and <em>The Mummy's Curse</em>. He also played the offspring of Count Dracula in <em>Son of Dracula</em>. Chaney is thus the only actor to portray all four of Universal's major monsters: the Wolf Man, Frankenstein's Monster, the Mummy, and the vampire son of Dracula.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Only a light crease through the ""D"" affects the signature. Accompanied by Letter of Authenticity by James Spence Authentication LLC.</p> <p><strong>JAMES BYRON DEAN</strong> (1931-1955) was a two-time Oscar-nominated American film actor. Dean's status as a cultural icon is best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, in which he starred as troubled stereotypical high school rebel Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his star power were as the awkward loner Cal Trask in <em>East of Eden</em>, and as the surly farmer Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>. His enduring fame and popularity rests on only three films, his entire starring output. His death at the young age of 24 helped guarantee a legendary status. He was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only person to have two posthumous acting nominations.</p>   <p>In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for an actor to play the role of ""Cal Trask"" in screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel <em>East of Eden</em>. The book dealt with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California in the mid-1800s through the 1910s. However, the film chose to deal predominantly with the character of Cal Trask, who is essentially the rebel son of a pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey), and estranged mother, whom Cal discovers is a brothel-keeping madam (Jo Van Fleet). Elia Kazan said of Cal before casting, ""I wanted a Brando for the role."" Osborn suggested to Kazan that he consider Dean for the part. After introducing Dean to Steinbeck, and gaining his enthusiastic approval, Kazan set about putting the wheels in motion to cast the relatively unknown young actor in the role. On March 8, 1954, Dean left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>. Both characters are rebel loners and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving parental guidance from a father figure.</p>   <p>Much of Dean's performance in the film is completely unscripted, such as his dance in the bean field and his curling up and pulling his arms inside of his shirt on top of the train during his ride home from meeting his mother. The most famous improvisation during the film was when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000 (which was in reparation for his father's business loss). Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and, crying, embraced him. This cut and Massey's shocked reaction were kept in the film by Kazan.</p>   <p>At the 1955 Academy Awards, he received a posthumous Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination for this role, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Many American teens at the time of Dean's major movies identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>: the typical teenager, caught where no one, not even his peers, can understand him. Journalist Joe Hyams says that Dean was ""one of the rare stars, like <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rock-hudson-movies-photo-signed-autographed-navy-photo-biography"" target=""_blank"">Rock Hudson</a> and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/montgomery-clift-signed-autographed-paramount-studios-receipt-photo"" target=""_blank"">Montgomery Clift</a>, who both men and women find sexy."" According to author and Harvard professor Marjorie Garber, this quality is ""the undefinable extra something that makes a star."" Dean's iconic appeal has been attributed to the public's need for someone to stand up for the disenfranchised young of the era, and to the air of androgyny that he projected onscreen.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

""Six Bridges to Cross"" was my first picture. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" with James Dean is my third and it will be out soon.

Your Cat Is Dead</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Salvatore Mineo, Jr.</strong> (1939-1976), better known as Sal Mineo, was an American film and theatre actor, best known for his performance opposite <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a> in the film <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>.</p>   <p>In 1955âthe year he wrote this letterâhe appeared in <em>three</em> films: <strong><em>Six Bridges to Cross</em></strong> with Tony Curtis; <strong><em>The Private War of Major Benson</em></strong> with Charleton Heston; and his first big breakthrough in <strong><em>Rebel Without A Cause</em></strong>, in which he played John ""Plato"" Crawford, the sensitive teenager smitten with Jim Stark (played by <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a>). His performance resulted in an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, and his popularity quickly developed. Mineo's biographer, Paul Jeffers, recounted that Mineo received thousands of fan letters from young female admirers, was mobbed by them at public appearances and further wrote, ""He dated the most beautiful women in Hollywood and New York.""</p>   <p>Mineo played a Mexican boy in <em>Giant</em> (1956), again with James Dean along with Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. But many of his subsequent roles were variations of his role in <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, and he was typecast as a troubled teen.</p>   <p>In 1957, Mineo made a brief foray into music by recording a handful of songs and an album. Two of his singles reached the Top 40 pop charts. The more popular of the two, ""<em>Start Movin' (In My Direction)</em>"", reached #9 on Billboard's pop chart. He also starred as famed drummer Gene Krupa in the movie <em>The Gene Krupa Story</em>, co-starring Susan Kohner, James Darren, and Susan Oliver, and directed by Don Weis.</p>   <p>By the early 1960s, he was becoming too old to play the type of role that had made him famous and was not considered appropriate for leading roles. He auditioned for David Lean's film <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> but was not hired. Mineo was baffled by his sudden loss of popularity, later saying ""One minute it seemed I had more movie offers than I could handle, the next, no one wanted me.""</p>   <p>In the late 1960s, Sal realized he also was attracted to men and was probably the first major actor in Hollywood to publicly admit his homosexual lifestyle, and was a pioneer in paving the way for future generations of gay actors. </p>   <p>By 1976 Mineo's career had begun to turn around. Playing the role of a gay burglar in a San Francisco run of the stage comedy <em>P.S. Your Cat Is Dead</em>, he received substantial publicity from many positive reviews and moved on to Los Angeles with the play. Arriving home after a rehearsal on February 12, 1976, Mineo was stabbed to death in the alley behind his West Hollywood apartment building. He was 37 years old.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He was known for brooding, sensitive, working-class character roles, and received four Academy Award nominations during his career. Appearing on Broadway at the age of thirteen, Clift achieved success on the stage and starred there for ten years before moving to Hollywood, debuting in 1948's <em>Red River</em> opposite John Wayne.<br/><br/>In 1958 he turned down what became Dean Martin's role in <em>Rio Bravo</em>, which would have reunited him with Wayne. This may have been because of the tension between the two actors: Wayne would refuse to socialize with Clift between takes during the filming of <em>Red River</em> because of Wayne's disapproval of Clift's sexuality.<br/><br/>Clift was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor that same year for <em>The Search</em>. His sensitive and intense quality gave him an image as the kind of a person to be taken care of. His love scenes with Elizabeth Taylor in <em>A Place in the Sun</em> (1951) represented a new standard for romance in cinema. His roles in <em>A Place in the Sun</em>, the 1953 classic <em>From Here to Eternity</em> and <em>The Young Lions</em> (1958) were career milestones.<br/><br/>Clift and Marlon Brando, who was also born in Omaha, had reputations as Hollywood rivals because of their rapid rise to stardom and similar acting styles. Clift was one of James Dean's idols and he would sometimes call him ""just to hear his voice.""</p> <p>Clift reportedly turned down the starring roles in <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> and <em>East of Eden</em>. At one point he was receiving so many offers of roles that scripts literally filled up his home. Friends had to squeeze past stacks of them in order to walk up the stairs.<br/><br/>On May 12, 1956, while filming <em>Raintree County</em>, he smashed his car into a telephone pole after leaving a party at the home of his <em>Raintree County</em> co-star Elizabeth Taylor and her then-husband Michael Wilding. Alerted by friend Kevin McCarthy, who witnessed the accident, Taylor raced to Clift's side and kept him from choking to death by removing two of his teeth, which had become lodged in his throat. Clift suffered spinal damage. Most of the injuries on his face were apparently below the skin; doctors elected not to do plastic surgery. In a filmed interview, he later described how his nose could be snapped back into place. After a long recovery, he returned to the set to finish the film. Against the movie studio's worries over profits, Clift rightly predicted the film would do well, if only because moviegoers would flock to see the difference in his facial appearance before and after the accident. The pain of the accident led him to rely on alcohol and pills for relief, as he had done after an earlier bout with dysentery (thanks to a film shot in Mexico) left him with chronic intestinal problems. As a result, Clift's health and looks deteriorated considerably. Taylor and Clift remained close friends until his death.<br/><br/>On Monday, July 22, 1966, Clift spent most of the day in his bedroom in his New York City townhouse. He and his live-in personal secretary, Lorenzo James, had not spoken much all day. At 1 a.m., Lorenzo went up to say goodnight. <em>The Misfits</em> was airing on TV that night, and Lorenzo asked Clift if he wanted to watch it. ""Absolutely NOT!"" was the reply. Those were his last words to anyone. At 6 a.m. the next morning, Lorenzo went to wake him, but found the bedroom door locked. Unable to break it down, he ran down to the garden and climbed a ladder to the bedroom window. When he got inside, he found Clift dead.

 Eddie Cochran, Eddie,Cochran,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/eddie-cochran-signed-autograph-photo/,Autograph Sentiment with Vintage Photo,"  <p><strong>Extremely scarce autograph sentiment in his beautifully florid script, <em>""Michael, Don't forget me, Eddie Cochran""</em>, on lightly toned paper, affixed to a 10"" x 12"" mat board beneath a gorgeous and rarely seen vintage photograph of Eddie. </strong>Minor white ink mark at top left edge of his hair, otherwise in fine condition.<strong><br/></strong></p> <p><strong>Edward Ray ""Eddie"" Cochran</strong> (1938-1960) was an American rock and roll musician and an important influence on popular music during the late 1950s, early 1960s. Having died at just 21 years old, Eddie Cochran remains one of the most sought after rock autographs in entertainment history, especially considering his impact on so many rock and roll giants who came after him.</p>   <p>His most famous hit, ""Summertime Blues"" was an important influence on music in the late 1950s, both lyrically and musically. Released on Liberty Records, the song charted #8 on August 25, 1958. Cochran's brief career included only a few more hits, such as ""C'mon Everybody"", ""Somethin' Else"", ""My Way"", ""Weekend"", ""Teenage Heaven"", ""Sitting in the Balcony"", ""Three Stars"", ""Nervous Breakdown"", and his posthumous UK number one hit ""Three Steps to Heaven.""</p>   <p>One of the first rock &amp; roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks, Cochran is credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string, in order to ""bend"" notes up a whole toneâan innovation which has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary. Artists such as The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Van Halen, Tom Petty, Rod Stewart, The Who, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Buck Owens, Dion, Paul McCartney, and Jimi Hendrix, among countless others, have covered his songs. Hendrix performed ""Summertime Blues"" early in his career and Pete Townshend of The Who was heavily influenced by Cochran's guitar style. </p>   <p>Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British Label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than had been released during his life. One of his posthumous releases was ""Three Stars,"" a tribute to J.P. Richardson, better known as The Big Bopper, and Eddie's friends Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, who had all died together in a plane crash just one year earlier. It was originally written and recorded by Tommy Dee just hours after the deaths were officially reported, and Cochran recorded his version the day after. His voice broke during the lyrics about Valens and Holly.</p>   <p>On Saturday, April 16, 1960, at about 11:50 p.m., while on tour in the United Kingdom, 21-year-old Cochran died in a traffic accident in a taxi in Chippenham, Wiltshire, about a hundred miles (163 km) west of London. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the <a href=""http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/eddie-cochran"">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. The Rockabilly Hall of Fame has also recognized his pioneering contribution to rockabilly. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group <strong>Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</strong> and their hit song ""Rock Around the Clock"".</p>   <p>The band was founded in 1952 and continued until Haley's death in 1981. Also known by the names Bill Haley and The Comets, the band was the earliest group of white musicians to bring rock and roll to the attention of white America and the rest of the world. From the end of 1954 until the end of 1956 the group would place nine singles into the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten.</p>   <p>Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of ""Rocket 88"", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound that came to be called rock and roll.</p>   <p>Although several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star. With his spit curl and the band's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior, many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as The Beatles or the Rolling Stones were in theirs.

After a few years on the stage, Colman had first appeared in films in England in 1917 and 1919 for Cecil Hepworth, and subsequently with the old Broadwest Film Company in <em>The Snow of the Desert</em>. While appearing on stage in New York in <em>La Tendress</em>, Director Henry King saw him, and engaged him as the leading man in the 1923 film, <em>The White Sister</em>, opposite Lillian Gish, and was an immediate success. </p> <p>As a result Colman virtually abandoned the stage for film. He became a very popular silent film star in both romantic and adventure films, among them <em>The Dark Angel</em> (1925), <em>Stella Dallas</em> (1926), <em>Beau Geste</em> (1927), and <em>The Winning of Barbara Worth</em> (1926). His dark hair and eyes and his athletic and riding ability (he did most of his own stunts until late in his career) led reviewers to describe him as a ""Valentino type"". He was often cast in similar, exotic roles. Towards the end of the silents era, Colman was teamed with Hungarian actress Vilma BÃ¡nky under Samuel Goldwyn and the two were a popular movie team rivalling Greta Garbo and John Gilbert.</p> <p>Although he was a huge success in silent films, he was unable to capitalize on one of his chief assets until the advent of the talking picture, ""his beautifully modulated and cultured voice"", also described as ""a bewitching, finely-modulated, resonant voice"". His first major talkie success was in 1930, when he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for two rolesâ<em>Condemned</em> and <em>Bulldog Drummond</em>. He appeared in a number of notable films including Raffles, The Masquerader, Clive of India, A Tale of Two Cities in 1935, Under Two Flags, The Prisoner of Zenda and Lost Horizon in 1937, If I Were King in 1938, and The Talk of the Town in 1941. He won the Best Actor Oscar in 1948 for A Double Life. At the time of his death, Colman was contracted by MGM for the lead role in Village of the Damned. However, Colman died and the film became a British production starring George Sanders, who had married Colman's widow, Benita Hume.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

His trademark role was that of the exasperated business tycoon or newspaperman, often as the father of the female lead character, as in <em>It Happened One Night</em> (1934) with Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert; <em>Broadway Bill</em> (1934), supporting Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy; and <em>Libeled Lady</em> (1936) with William Powell and Loy again.

Only a light crease through the ""D"" affects the signature. Accompanied by Letter of Authenticity by James Spence Authentication LLC.</p> <p><strong>JAMES BYRON DEAN</strong> (1931-1955) was a two-time Oscar-nominated American film actor. Dean's status as a cultural icon is best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, in which he starred as troubled stereotypical high school rebel Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his star power were as the awkward loner Cal Trask in <em>East of Eden</em>, and as the surly farmer Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>. His enduring fame and popularity rests on only three films, his entire starring output. His death at the young age of 24 helped guarantee a legendary status. He was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only person to have two posthumous acting nominations.</p>   <p>In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for an actor to play the role of ""Cal Trask"" in screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel <em>East of Eden</em>. The book dealt with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California in the mid-1800s through the 1910s. However, the film chose to deal predominantly with the character of Cal Trask, who is essentially the rebel son of a pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey), and estranged mother, whom Cal discovers is a brothel-keeping madam (Jo Van Fleet). Elia Kazan said of Cal before casting, ""I wanted a Brando for the role."" Osborn suggested to Kazan that he consider Dean for the part. After introducing Dean to Steinbeck, and gaining his enthusiastic approval, Kazan set about putting the wheels in motion to cast the relatively unknown young actor in the role. On March 8, 1954, Dean left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>. Both characters are rebel loners and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving parental guidance from a father figure.</p>   <p>Much of Dean's performance in the film is completely unscripted, such as his dance in the bean field and his curling up and pulling his arms inside of his shirt on top of the train during his ride home from meeting his mother. The most famous improvisation during the film was when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000 (which was in reparation for his father's business loss). Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and, crying, embraced him. This cut and Massey's shocked reaction were kept in the film by Kazan.</p>   <p>At the 1955 Academy Awards, he received a posthumous Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination for this role, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Many American teens at the time of Dean's major movies identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>: the typical teenager, caught where no one, not even his peers, can understand him.

According to author and Harvard professor Marjorie Garber, this quality is ""the undefinable extra something that makes a star."" Dean's iconic appeal has been attributed to the public's need for someone to stand up for the disenfranchised young of the era, and to the air of androgyny that he projected onscreen.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

His performance resulted in an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, and his popularity quickly developed. Mineo's biographer, Paul Jeffers, recounted that Mineo received thousands of fan letters from young female admirers, was mobbed by them at public appearances and further wrote, ""He dated the most beautiful women in Hollywood and New York.""</p>   <p>Mineo played a Mexican boy in <em>Giant</em> (1956), again with James Dean along with Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. But many of his subsequent roles were variations of his role in <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, and he was typecast as a troubled teen.</p>   <p>In 1957, Mineo made a brief foray into music by recording a handful of songs and an album. Two of his singles reached the Top 40 pop charts. The more popular of the two, ""<em>Start Movin' (In My Direction)</em>"", reached #9 on Billboard's pop chart. He also starred as famed drummer Gene Krupa in the movie <em>The Gene Krupa Story</em>, co-starring Susan Kohner, James Darren, and Susan Oliver, and directed by Don Weis.</p>   <p>By the early 1960s, he was becoming too old to play the type of role that had made him famous and was not considered appropriate for leading roles.

Mineo was baffled by his sudden loss of popularity, later saying ""One minute it seemed I had more movie offers than I could handle, the next, no one wanted me.""</p>   <p>In the late 1960s, Sal realized he also was attracted to men and was probably the first major actor in Hollywood to publicly admit his homosexual lifestyle, and was a pioneer in paving the way for future generations of gay actors. </p>   <p>By 1976 Mineo's career had begun to turn around. Playing the role of a gay burglar in a San Francisco run of the stage comedy <em>P.S. Your Cat Is Dead</em>, he received substantial publicity from many positive reviews and moved on to Los Angeles with the play. Arriving home after a rehearsal on February 12, 1976, Mineo was stabbed to death in the alley behind his West Hollywood apartment building.

According to Hunter in his 2005 autobiography <em>Tab Hunter Confidential</em>, ""I was with Dick [Clayton, his agent] one night when he had to deliver contracts to Jimmy on the set of <em>Rebel</em>...Â  Jimmy and I hung around outside while the crew prepped another setup. An enterprising studio publicity photographer saw us chatting and began snapping dozens of picturesâthe polar opposites of America's youth culture, captured together.""</p> <p><strong>TAB HUNTER</strong> (born July 11, 1931) is an American actor and singer, who has starred in over forty major motion pictures.<br/><br/>Born Arthur Gelien, he was signed to a contract at Warner Bros. and christened ""Tab Hunter"" by his first agent, Henry Willson. His good looks got him pegged as a screen idol (dubbed the ""Sigh Guy""). He landed a role in the film <em>Island of Desire</em> opposite Linda Darnell. However, it was his co-starring role as young Marine Danny in 1955's World War II drama <em>Battle Cry</em>, in which he has an affair with an older woman but ends up marrying the girl next door, that cemented his position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads. He went on to star in over 40 major Holywood films.<br/><br/>Hunter had a 1957 hit record with a cover of the song ""Young Love"", which was #1 on the charts for six weeks. He also had the hit ""Ninety-Nine Ways"", which peaked at #11 in the charts, and was actually his first single, before ""Young Love"". His success prompted Jack Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single, from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter, although his singing career foundered after a few more recordings.<br/><br/>Hunter's best role during this period was in the 1958 musical movie <em>Damn Yankees</em>, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington D.C's American League baseball club. The movie had originally been a Broadway show, and Hunter was the only one in the film version who hadn't appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book <em>The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant</em> by Douglass Wallop.<br/><br/>Hunter has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6320 Hollywood Blvd.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Dressler's first role in a film was in 1910, when she was 42. and she quickly became Hollywood's number one box-office attraction, staying on top until her death at age 65. </p> <p>In addition to her comedic genius and her natural elegance, Dressler demonstrated her considerable talents by taking on serious roles. For her starring portrayal in <em>Min and Bill</em>, co-starring Wallace Beery, she won the 1930-31 Academy Award for Best Actress (the eligibility years were staggered at that time). Dressler was nominated again for Best Actress for her 1932 starring role in <em>Emma</em>. With that film, Dressler demonstrated her profound generosity to other performers. Dressler personally insisted that her studio bosses cast a friend of hers, a largely unknown young actor named Richard Cromwell, in the lead opposite her. This break helped launch his career.</p> <p>Dressler followed these successes with more hits in 1933, including the comedy <em>Dinner at Eight</em>, in which she played an aging but vivacious former stage actress, and, following the release of that film, appeared on the cover of <em>Time</em> magazine, in its August 7, 1933, issue.</p> <p>Dressler appeared in more than 40 films, and achieved her greatest successes in talking pictures made during the last years of her life. Always seeing herself as physically unattractive, she wrote an autobiography titled, <em>The Life Story of an Ugly Duckling</em>.</p> <p><img alt=""Marie Dressler"" height=""205"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/thumblg_260AB0E9-1517-6111-28481322B14C29FF.jpg"" title=""Marie Dressler"" width=""159""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Duke Ellington, Duke,Ellington,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/duke-ellington-signed-contract-queens-suite-autographed/,CBS Records Contract Signed,"  <p><strong>Duke Ellington 1972 Signed Contract. Three pages, dated October 1, 1972 on CBS letterhead, signed by Ellington in blue ink. In the agreement, Ellington requests the ""licensing back of his 1956 recording ""The Queen's Suite"", which was written as a thank-you to Queen Elizabeth.</strong> Very Fine condition. Accompanied by James Spence Letter of Authentication.</p> <p><strong>Edward Kennedy ""Duke"" Ellington</strong> (1899-1974) was an American composer, pianist, and big band leader. Ellington wrote over 1,000 compositions. In the words of Bob Blumenthal of <em>The Boston Globe</em>, ""In the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.""</p> <p>Ellington's appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival on July 7, 1956 returned him to wider prominence and exposed him to new audiences. The feature <em>Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue</em>, with saxophonist Paul Gonsalves's six-minute saxophone solo, had been in the band's book since 1937, but on this occasion nearly created a riot. The revived attention should not have surprised anyoneâHodges had returned to the fold the previous year, and Ellington's collaboration with Strayhorn had been renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man. <em>Such Sweet Thunder</em> (1957), based on Shakespeare's plays and characters, and <strong><em>The Queen's Suite</em></strong> (the subject of this contract, and which Ellington dedicated to Queen Elizabeth IIâand the music for which was never released during his lifetime), were products of the renewed impetus which the Newport appearance helped to create.Â </p> <p>A prominent figure in the history of jazz, Ellington's music stretched into various other genres, including blues, gospel, film scores, popular, and classical. His career spanned more than 50 years and included leading his orchestra, composing an inexhaustible songbook, scoring for movies, composing stage musicals, and world tours. Several of his instrumental works were adapted into songs that became standards. Due to his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, and thanks to his eloquence and extraordinary charisma, he is generally considered to have elevated the perception of jazz to an art form on a par with other traditional genres of music. His reputation increased after his death and the Pulitzer Prize Board bestowed on him a special posthumous honor in 1999.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

For British television, they wrote situation comedies such as <em>The Army Game, Bootsie and Snudge</em>, and the BBC radio show <em>Round the Horne</em>, which starred Kenneth Horne and Kenneth Williams. This put Feldman and Took ""in the front rank of comedy writers."" </p>   <p>The television sketch comedy series <em>At Last the 1948 Show</em> featured Feldman's first screen performances. The other three performers needed a fourth and Brooke-Taylor and Cleese had Feldman in mind. In one sketch on 1 March 1967, Feldman harassed a patient shop assistant (John Cleese) for a series of fictitious books, achieving success with <em>Ethel the Aardvark Goes Quantity Surveying</em>. The sketch was revived as part of the Monty Python stage show and on <em>Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album</em> (both without Feldman).</p>   <p>Marty Feldman was co-author, with John Cleese, Graham Chapman and Tim Brooke-Taylor, of the ""Four Yorkshiremen"" sketch, which was also written for <em>At Last the 1948 Show</em>. The ""Four Yorkshiremen"" sketch was performed during Amnesty International concerts (by members of Monty Python - once including Rowan Atkinson in place of Python member Eric Idle), as well as during <em>Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl</em> and other Monty Python shows and records. This has led to the ""Four Yorkshiremen"" sketch being considered a Python sketch, the origin and co-authorship by non-Python writers Marty Feldman and Tim Brooke-Taylor overlooked or forgotten. Feldman was also script editor on <em>The Frost Report</em> with future members of Monty Python. He wrote the ""Class"" sketch, Cleese, Ronnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett facing the audience in descending order of height declaring their social status.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Feldman's performances on American television included <em>The Dean Martin Show </em>and <em>Marty Feldman's Comedy Machine</em>.

Studio stationery</strong>, 4 1â4"" x 6 1â2"", February 5, 1936, to Texas fan Catherine McPolan (whom census records indicate was 16 years old at the time). Flynn was famous for his drinking,  womanizing, and brawling. His freewheeling, hedonistic lifestyle caught  up with him in November 1942 when teenagers Betty Hansen and Peggy  Satterlee accused him of statutory rape. A group was organised to  support Flynn, named the <em>American Boys' Club for the Defence of Errol  Flynn</em> (ABCDEF); somewhat shockingly its members included conservative lion William F. Buckley, Jr. </p> <p>The trial  took place in January and February, 1943, and Flynn was cleared of the  charges. But the incident served to increase his reputation as a ladies'  man, which led to the popular belief that the term ""<em>in like Flynn</em>"" was  based on the actor's romantic exploits, though the true origin of the phrase is still unverified. In full, verbatim:</p> <blockquote><p> <em>My dear Catherine:</em></p><p><em>I am very sorry not have answered your letter before, but have been so very busy. Now I am in the hospital and have a little time to answer some of the letters I have wanted to.</em></p><p><em>Thank you so much for writing, it was very much appreciated, and if you have someplace, a snapshot of yourself, I would very much like to have it.</em></p><p><em>I am saving photographs of all the people who write me<font class=""f1"" size=""3"">â</font>that is those few letters that sound sensible<font class=""f1"" size=""3"">â</font>and those I think I would like to know better.</em><style type=""text/css"">font.f1 { font: 12px Georgia; }</style><style type=""text/css"">font.f1 { font: 12px Georgia; }</style></p><p><em>My very kindest regards / Sincerely / Errol Flynn </em></p></blockquote> <p>The original envelope is included.

Posters incorrectly advertised the film as ""Destination Tokio"" despite Tokyo's proper spelling appearing in the film's on-screen title.</p> <p><strong>John Garfield</strong> (1913-1952) was an American actor adept at playing brooding, rebellious, working-class characters. He grew up in poverty in Depression-era New York City and in the early 1930s became an important member of the Group Theater. In 1937, he moved to Hollywood, eventually becoming one of Warner Bros.' major stars. Garfield is acknowledged as a predecessor of such Method actors as Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, and James Dean.</p> <p>At the onset of World War II, Garfield immediately attempted to enlist in the armed forces, but was turned down because of a heart condition. Frustrated, he turned his energies to supporting the war effort. He and actress Bette Davis were the driving forces behind the opening of the Hollywood Canteen, a club offering food and entertainment for American servicemen. He traveled overseas to help entertain the troops, made several bond selling tours and starred in a string of popular, patriotic films like Air Force, Destination Tokyo (as depicted in this photo) and Pride of the Marines, all box office successes.</p> <p>Like many in Hollywood at the time, Garfield was caught up in the Communist scare of the late 1940s and early 1950s. He supported the Committee for the First Amendment, which opposed governmental investigation of political beliefs. Called to testify before the U.S. Congressional House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC), he denied Communist affiliation and refused to ""name names"", effectively ending his film career. </p> <p>Some have claimed that the stress of this incident led to his premature death at 39 from a heart attack. Garfield's funeral in New York was mobbed by 10,000 distraught fans, a sight not seen since the death of silent screen idol Rudolph Valentino over two decades earlier. </p>  ",1943,sold,1,FALSE,3594,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/91855D83-1517-6111-28EAA79C9B5297A2.png,

Her iconic bathing suit photo made her the number-one pin-up girl of the World War II era. It was later included in the <em>Life</em> magazine project ""100 Photos that Changed the World"". Grable was particularly noted for having the most beautiful legs in Hollywood and studio publicity widely dispersed photos featuring them.<br/><br/>As the 1930's ended, after small parts in over 50 Hollywood movies throughout the 1930s - Grable finally gained national attention on stage for her role in the Cole Porter Broadway hit <em>Du Barry Was a Lady</em> (1939).<br/><br/>In 1940, Grable obtained a contract with 20th Century Fox, becoming their top star throughout the decade, with Technicolor movies such as <em>Down Argentine Way</em> (1940), <em>Moon Over Miami</em> (1941) (both with Don Ameche), <em>Springtime in The Rockies</em> (1942), <em>Coney Island</em> (1943) with George Montgomery, <em>Sweet Rosie O'Grady</em> (1943) with Robert Young, <em>Pin Up Girl</em> (1944), <em>Diamond Horseshoe</em> (1945) with Dick Haymes, <em>The Dolly Sisters</em> (1945) with John Payne and June Haver.<br/><br/>It was during her reign as box office queen (in 1943) that Grable posed for her famous pinup photo, which (along with her movies) soon became escapist fare among GIs fighting in World War II. The image was taken by studio photographer Frank Powolny, who died in 1986. It was rumored that the particular pose and angle were chosen to hide the fact that Grable was pregnant at the time of the photo.

She was wildly popular at home as well, placing in the top 10 box office draws for 10 years. By the end of the 1940s Grable was the highest-paid female star in Hollywood, receiving $300,000 a year.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Mounting tape on two corners, otherwise fine condition.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>RANDOLPH SCOTT</strong> (1898-1987) was an American motion picture actor whose career spanned from 1928 to 1962. As a leading man for all but the first three years of his cinematic career, Scott appeared in a variety of genres, including social dramas, crime dramas, comedies, adventure tales, war films, and even a few horror and fantasy films. However, his most enduring image is that of the tall-in-the-saddle Western hero. Out of his more than 100 film appearances more than 60 were in Westerns.</p>   <p>Scott's more than thirty years as a motion picture actor resulted in his working frequently with many acclaimed screen directors, including Henry King, Rouben Mamoulian, Michael Curtiz, John Cromwell, King Vidor, Alan Dwan, Fritz Lang, and Sam Peckinpah. </p>   <p>Scott also worked with a widely diverse array of cinematic leading ladies, from Shirley Temple and Irene Dunne to Mae West and Marlene Dietrich. He also appeared with Gene Tierney, Ann Sheridan, Maureen O'Hara, Nancy Carroll, Donna Reed, Gail Russell, Margaret Sullavan, Virginia Mayo, Bebe Daniels, Carole Lombard, and Joan Bennett.</p>   <p>Tall, lanky, and handsome, Scott displayed an easygoing charm and courtly Southern drawl in his early films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or lumbering. As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal ""strong, silent"" type of stoic hero.</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

RCA owned NBC (and the series) and wanted to use it to spur sales of color television sets. However, the Saturday night ratings were dismal and <em>Bonanza </em>was soon targeted for cancellation. Given one last chance, it was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 PM. The new time slot caused the series to soar, and it eventually reached number one by the mid-'60s; by 1970, it had become the first series to ever wind up in the Top Five for nine consecutive seasons (a record which would stand for decades) and thus established itself as the single biggest hit TV series of the 1960s; it remained high on the Nielsen ratings until 1971, when it finally fell out of the top ten. </p> <p>Â <img alt=""Bonanza Cast"" height=""330"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/6B483853-3048-C0CE-557F792E339C16CA.jpg"" title=""Bonanza Cast"" width=""310""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Groening distributed <em>Life in Hell</em> in the book corner of Licorice Pizza, a record store in California where he worked. He made his first professional cartoon sale to the avant-garde <em>Wet</em> magazine in 1978. The cartoon is still carried in 250 weekly newspapers.</p>   <p><em>Life in Hell</em> caught the attention of James L. Brooks. In 1985, Brooks contacted Groening with the proposition of working in animation for the FOX variety show <em>The Tracey Ullman Show</em>. Originally, Brooks wanted Groening to adapt his <em>Life in Hell</em> characters for the show. Fearing the loss of ownership rights, Groening decided to create something new and came up with a cartoon family, the Simpsons and named the members after his own parents and sistersâwhile Bart was an anagram of the word brat. The shorts would be spun off into their own series: <em>The Simpsons</em>, which has since aired over 400 episodes in 19 seasons. In 1997, Groening got together with David X. Cohen and developed <em>Futurama</em>, an animated series about life in the year 3000, which premiered in 1999. After four years on the air, the show was cancelled by Fox in 2003.</p> <p>Groening has won 11 Primetime Emmy Awards, ten for <em>The Simpsons</em> and one for <em>Futurama</em> as well as a British Comedy Award for ""outstanding contribution to comedy"" in 2004. In 2002, he won the National Cartoonist Society Reuben Award for his work on <em>Life in Hell</em>.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

After performing roles in Australian television and film during the 1990s, Ledger moved to the United States in 1998 to develop his film career. His work encompassed nineteen films, including <em>10 Things I Hate About You</em> (1999), <em>The Patriot</em> (2000), <em>Monster's Ball</em> (2001), <em>A Knight's Tale</em> (2001), <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> (2005), and <em>The Dark Knight</em> (2008).

A few months before his death, he had finished filming his penultimate performance, as the Joker in <em>The Dark Knight</em>, his death coming during editing of the film and casting a shadow over the subsequent promotion of the $180 million production. At the time of his death, on 22 January 2008, he had completed about half of his work performing the role of Tony in Terry Gilliam's film <em>The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Jacob ""Jake"" Gyllenhaal</strong> (1980-) is an American actor who began acting at age ten. He has appeared in diverse roles since his first lead role in 1999's <em>October Sky</em>, followed by the 2001 indie cult hit <em>Donnie Darko</em>, in which he played a psychologically troubled teen and onscreen brother to his real-life sister, actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. In the 2004 blockbuster <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em> he portrayed a student caught in a cataclysmic global cooling event, alongside Dennis Quaid as his father. He then played against type as a frustrated Marine in <em>Jarhead</em> (2005). The same year, he won critical acclaim as Jack Twist in the film <em>Brokeback Mountain</em> opposite Heath Ledger.</p>   <p><em>Brokeback Mountain</em> is a 2005 American romantic-drama film that depicts the complex romantic and sexual relationship between two men in the American West from 1963 to 1981.</p>   <p>In <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play young men who meet as sheep herders and embark upon a sexual relationship that begins in the summer of 1963 and continues until the death of Gyllenhaal's character in 1981. The film was often referred to in the media with the shorthand phrase ""the gay cowboy movie,"" though there was differing opinion on the sexual orientation of the characters. Gyllenhaal was nominated for an Academy Award in the category of Best Supporting Actor for his performance, but lost to George Clooney for <em>Syriana</em>. Gyllenhaal also won the Best Supporting Actor BAFTA for the same role and received a Best Supporting Actor nomination and Best Film Ensemble nomination from the Screen Actors Guild.

Having died at just 21 years old, Eddie Cochran remains one of the most sought after rock autographs in entertainment history, especially considering his impact on so many rock and roll giants who came after him.</p>   <p>His most famous hit, ""Summertime Blues"" was an important influence on music in the late 1950s, both lyrically and musically. Released on Liberty Records, the song charted #8 on August 25, 1958. Cochran's brief career included only a few more hits, such as ""C'mon Everybody"", ""Somethin' Else"", ""My Way"", ""Weekend"", ""Teenage Heaven"", ""Sitting in the Balcony"", ""Three Stars"", ""Nervous Breakdown"", and his posthumous UK number one hit ""Three Steps to Heaven.""</p>   <p>One of the first rock &amp; roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks, Cochran is credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string, in order to ""bend"" notes up a whole toneâan innovation which has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary. Artists such as The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Van Halen, Tom Petty, Rod Stewart, The Who, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Buck Owens, Dion, Paul McCartney, and Jimi Hendrix, among countless others, have covered his songs. Hendrix performed ""Summertime Blues"" early in his career and Pete Townshend of The Who was heavily influenced by Cochran's guitar style. </p>   <p>Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British Label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than had been released during his life. One of his posthumous releases was ""Three Stars,"" a tribute to J.P. Richardson, better known as The Big Bopper, and Eddie's friends Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, who had all died together in a plane crash just one year earlier. It was originally written and recorded by Tommy Dee just hours after the deaths were officially reported, and Cochran recorded his version the day after. His voice broke during the lyrics about Valens and Holly.</p>   <p>On Saturday, April 16, 1960, at about 11:50 p.m., while on tour in the United Kingdom, 21-year-old Cochran died in a traffic accident in a taxi in Chippenham, Wiltshire, about a hundred miles (163 km) west of London. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the <a href=""http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/eddie-cochran"">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. The Rockabilly Hall of Fame has also recognized his pioneering contribution to rockabilly. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He is credited by many with first popularizing this form of music in the early 1950s with his group <strong>Bill Haley &amp; His Comets</strong> and their hit song ""Rock Around the Clock"".</p>   <p>The band was founded in 1952 and continued until Haley's death in 1981. Also known by the names Bill Haley and The Comets, the band was the earliest group of white musicians to bring rock and roll to the attention of white America and the rest of the world. From the end of 1954 until the end of 1956 the group would place nine singles into the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten.</p>   <p>Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of ""Rocket 88"", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound that came to be called rock and roll.</p>   <p>Although several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star. With his spit curl and the band's matching plaid dinner jackets and energetic stage behavior, many fans consider them to be as revolutionary in their time as The Beatles or the Rolling Stones were in theirs.

 Jean Harlow, Jean,Harlow,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/jean-harlow-photo-signed-autographed-signature-photo-inscribed-william-wyler/,Signed Vintage Photo Inscribed to William Wyler,"  <p>Signed Photograph to William Wyler. Extremely scarce, uncommon 10.5"" x 13"" large format image of the seductive screen legend, personally inscribed to renowned director William Wyler and signed by Harlow herself:<em><strong></strong></em></p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>""Willie"" darling - Loads of love to you, From Jean</strong></em></p></blockquote> <p>One of the rarest and most sought-after Hollywood autographs in an exceptional large format and with a remarkable association.</p> <p>Known as the ""Blonde Bombshell"" due to her famous platinum blonde hair, Jean Harlow (1911-1937) ranks as one of the greatest movie stars of all time by the American Film Institute. She starred in 32 feature films and numerous short subjects, mainly designed to showcase her magnetic sex appeal and strong screen presence, before transitioning to more developed roles and achieving massive fame under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Harlow's enormous popularity and ""laughing vamp"" image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, and ultimately, her sudden death from renal failure at age 26. Consequently, authentic autographs by the young Jean Harlow are extremely scarce and highly collectible. Her mother, known as Mama Jean (and also named Jean Harlow) signed the vast majority of her daughter's letters and photographs, and genuine autographs are hard to come by.</p> <p>William ""Willie"" Wyler (1902 -1981) was a three-time Academy Award-winning motion picture director. In the early 1930s he became one of Universal's greatest assets, directing such solid films as <em>The Love Trap, Hell's Heroes</em>, and <em>The Good Fairy</em>. He became well-known for his merciless (some would say sadistic) insistence on multiple retakes, resulting in often award-winning and critically acclaimed performances from his actors. After leaving Universal he began a long collaboration with Samuel Goldwyn where he directed such classics as <em>The Best Years of Our Lives</em> (1946), <em>The Little Foxes</em> (1941), <em>The Westerner</em> (1940), and <em>Wuthering Heights</em> (1939). Laurence Olivier, whom Wyler directed to two Oscar nominations in two films, credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen. Bette Davis not only received three Oscar nominations for her screen work under Wyler, but won her second Oscar for her performance in Wyler's 1938 film <em>Jezebel</em>. Charlton Heston won his only nomination and Best Actor Oscar for his work in Wyler's 1959 blockbuster <em>Ben-Hur</em>.</p> <p>MGM was where Harlow became a superstar. She was given superior movie roles to show off not only her beauty, but what turned out to be a genuine talent for comedy. In 1931, she had the starring roles in <em>Red-Headed Woman</em>, for which she received a salary of $1,250 per week, and <em>Red Dust</em>, her second film with Clark Gable. These films showed her to be much more at ease in front of the camera and highlighted her skill as a comedienne. Harlow and Gable worked well together and co-starred in a total of six films; she was also paired multiple times with Spencer Tracy and William Powell, whom she almost married.</p> <p>As her star ascended, sometimes the power of Harlow's name was used to boost up-and-coming male co-stars, such as Robert Taylor and Franchot Tone. Evolving tastes, plus the grooming MGM was noted for, changed Harlow from a brassy, exotic platinum blonde to the more mainstream, all-American type preferred by studio boss Louis B. Mayer; the screen Harlow at the end of her life was quite different from that of 1930, when audiences first took notice of her.</p> <p>Â </p> <object classid=""clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"" codebase=""http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"" height=""337"" width=""410""><param name=""width"" value=""410""/><param name=""height"" value=""337""/><param name=""wmode"" value=""opaque""/><param name=""src"" value=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Kr_VpZEs4gA""/><embed height=""337"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/v/Kr_VpZEs4gA"" type=""application/x-shockwave-flash"" width=""410"" wmode=""opaque""/></object>   <p>Â </p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                                                                     </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p>  ",c1930s,sold,1,FALSE,3135,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/7D4E27CE-3048-C0CE-55F6A9AB8C92C2AB.jpg,

Archivally framed in gold and cocoa tones. Accompanied by an <em>original</em> photograph by famed glamour photographer George Hurrell, printed by the Hurrell Studios from the 1934 negative on high-gloss photo paper. This scene, ""Bearskin Rug"", is Harlow's most well-known photo, and is accompanied by the photographer's Hollywood studio Certificate of Authentication. The image, taken at Harlow's home, was originally published as a full-page spread in Vanity Fair magazine.</strong></p>   <p>As described by <em>Vanity Fair</em> at the time:</p>   <blockquote><p>""In this iconic Hollywood image from 1934, photographer George Hurrell realized that the ideal prop for the sultry Harlow was a horizontal companion. Although Hurrell used sidelight here to simulate a roaring fire (to pretend that Harlow was merely lounging around at home on a winter night), he was known for his pioneering work with a new photographic tool, the boom light, which gave his pictures a peculiar clarity and coolness, as if illuminated by moonbeams. That nocturnal incandescence and pinpoint sharpness (in contrast to the gauzy diffusion many of his peers preferred) transformed Hurrell from a creator of studio publicity stills to a master of the glamour portrait."" <em>Â© CondÃ© Nast Publications Inc.

She and Nibbles were  virtually inseparable during the shooting of <em>National Velvet</em> and other  films; in fact the chipmunk almost got to appear in Taylor's 1946 film <em> Courage of Lassie</em>âbut he was so well behaved that he didn't look  real, and his scene was cut.</p> <p><strong>Elizabeth ""Liz"" Taylor, DBE</strong><em> (Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire)</em> (1932-2011) was a  British-American actress.

Exquisitely framed in a black Gothic theme, together with an image from his landmark 1960 thriller <em>Psycho</em>, and a printed photo of Sir Alfred himself along with a small identification plaque.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>SIR ALFRED HITCHCOCK </strong>(1899 -1980) was an iconic and influential British filmmaker and producer, who pioneered many techniques in the suspense and psychological thriller genres.</p>   <p>After a substantial career in his native United Kingdom in both silent films and talkies, Hitchcock moved to Hollywood and, in 1956, became an American citizen, also retaining his British citizenship. Hitchcock directed more than fifty feature films, in a career spanning six decades, from the silent era, through the invention of sound films, and far into the color era. As a director, he was among the most consistently recognizable by the general public, and was one of the most successful of his era. He remains one of the best-known and most popular filmmakers of all time.</p>   <p>In his youth Hitchcock was sent to the Jesuit Classic school St. Ignatius College in Enfield, London. He often described his childhood as being very lonely and sheltered, which was compounded by his weight issues. It is widely known that as a child, Hitchcock was once sent by his father to the local police station with a note asking the officer to lock him away for ten minutes as punishment for behaving badly. This idea of being harshly treated or wrongfully accused is frequently reflected in Hitchcock's films.</p>   <p>Hitchcock's mother would often make him address her while standing at the foot of her bed, especially if he behaved badly, forcing him to stand there for hours. These experiences of Hitchcock would later be used for the portrayal of the character of Norman Bates in his movie <em>Psycho</em>.</p>   <p>Â </p>   <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

A classic and historical one-of-a-kind memento of Hollywood in very good condition.</p> <p><em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em> is well known for its title sequence. The camera fades in on a simple line-drawing caricature of Hitchcock's rotund profile. As the program's theme music, Charles Gounod's <em>Funeral March of a Marionette</em>, plays, Hitchcock himself appears in silhouette from the right edge of the screen, and then walks to center screen to eclipse the caricature. He then almost always says ""Good evening."" </p> <p>The drawing was the work of Hitchcock himself. He began his career in the 1920s as an illustrator for silent movie intertitle cards. The sequence has been parodied countless times in films and on television. The caricature and the use of Gounod's <em>Funeral March of a Marionette</em> as theme music have become indelibly associated with Hitchcock in popular culture.</p>   <p>Hitchcock closed the show in much the same way as it opened but mainly to tie up loose ends rather than joke. He told <em>TV Guide</em> that his reassurances that the criminal had been apprehended were ""a necessary gesture to morality.""</p>   <p>Originally 30 minutes per episode, the series expanded to 60 minutes in 1962 and retitled <em>The Alfred Hitchcock Hour</em>. Hitchcock himself only directed 17 of the 270 filmed episodes of <em>Alfred Hitchcock Presents</em>.</p>   <p>The last new episode aired on June 26, 1965, but the series continued to be popular in syndication for decades. The first season was released on DVD in 2005, the second season in 2006, and the third in October 2007. </p>  ",1955,sold,1,FALSE,3360,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/1672AC0E-1517-6111-28B7D1670DF54030.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/167306A2-1517-6111-282469D3DF56636E.jpg",

He was voted Star of the Year, Favorite Leading Man, and similar titles by numerous movie magazines and was unquestionably one of the most popular and well-known movie stars of the time. He completed nearly 70 motion pictures and starred in several television productions during a career that spanned over four decades. Hudson was also one of the first major Hollywood celebrities to die from an AIDS related illness.</p>   <p>Hudson was born Roy Harold Scherer, Jr., in Winnetka, Illinois, the son of Katherine Wood, a telephone operator, and Roy Harold Scherer, Sr., an auto mechanic who abandoned the family during the depths of the Great Depression. His mother remarried and his stepfather Wallace ""Wally"" Fitzgerald adopted him, changing his last name to Fitzgerald. Hudson's years at New Trier High School were unremarkable. He sang in the school's glee club and was remembered as a shy boy who delivered newspapers, ran errands and worked as a golf caddy.</p>   <p>After graduating from high school, he served in the Philippines as an aircraft mechanic for the United States Navy during World War II. In 1946, Hudson moved to the Los Angeles area to pursue an acting career and applied to the University of Southern California's dramatics program, but he was rejected owing to poor grades. Hudson worked for a time as a truck driver, longing to be an actor but with no success in breaking into the movies. A fortunate meeting with Hollywood talent scout Henry Willson in 1948 got Hudson his start in the business.</p>   <p>Hudson made his debut with a small part in the 1948 Warner Bros.' <em>Fighter Squadron</em>. Hudson needed no less than 38 takes before successfully delivering his only line in the film.</p>   <p>He was further coached in acting, singing, dancing, fencing and horseback riding, and he began to feature in film magazines where he was promoted, possibly on the basis of his good looks. Success and recognition came in 1954 with <em>Magnificent Obsession</em> in which Hudson plays a bad boy who is redeemed opposite the popular star Jane Wyman. The film received rave reviews, with <em>Modern Screen Magazine</em> citing Hudson as the most popular actor of the year. Hudson's popularity soared in George Stevens's <em>Giant</em>, based on Edna Ferber's novel and co-starring Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean. As a result of their powerful performances, both Hudson and Dean were nominated for Oscars in the Best Actor category.</p> <p>Following Richard Brooks's notable <em>Something of Value</em> in 1957 and a moving performance in Charles Vidor's <em>A Farewell to Arms</em>, based on Ernest Hemingway's novel, Hudson sailed through the 1960s on a wave of romantic comedies. He portrayed humorous characters in <em>Pillow Talk</em>, the first of several profitable co-starring performances with Doris Day. This was followed by <em>Come September, Send Me No Flowers, Man's Favorite Sport?, The Spiral Road</em>, and <em>Strange Bedfellows</em>. He worked outside his usual range on the science-fiction thriller <em>Seconds</em> (1966). The film flopped badly at the time but it later gained cult status, and his performance is often regarded as one of his best.</p>   <p>Hudson had been diagnosed with HIV on June 5, 1984, but when the signs of illness became apparent, his publicity staff and doctors told the public he had inoperable liver cancer. It was not until July 25, 1985, while in Paris for treatment, that Hudson issued a press release announcing that he was dying of AIDS. In a later press release, Hudson speculated he might have contracted HIV through transfused blood from an infected donor during the multiple blood transfusions he received as part of his heart bypass procedure. Hudson flew back to Los Angeles on July 31, where he was so physically weak he was taken off by stretcher from an Air France Boeing 747, which he chartered and was the sole passenger along with his medical attendants. He was flown by helicopter to Cedars Sinai Hospital, where he spent nearly a month undergoing further treatment. When the doctors told him there was no hope of saving his life, since the disease had progressed into the advanced stages, Hudson returned to his house, ""The Castle,"" in Beverly Hills, where he remained in seclusion until his death on October 2 at 08:37 PST. Morgan Fairchild said ""Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face"".</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

""Six Bridges to Cross"" was my first picture. ""Rebel Without a Cause"" with James Dean is my third and it will be out soon.

Your Cat Is Dead</em>.</p>   <p><strong>Salvatore Mineo, Jr.</strong> (1939-1976), better known as Sal Mineo, was an American film and theatre actor, best known for his performance opposite <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a> in the film <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>.</p>   <p>In 1955âthe year he wrote this letterâhe appeared in <em>three</em> films: <strong><em>Six Bridges to Cross</em></strong> with Tony Curtis; <strong><em>The Private War of Major Benson</em></strong> with Charleton Heston; and his first big breakthrough in <strong><em>Rebel Without A Cause</em></strong>, in which he played John ""Plato"" Crawford, the sensitive teenager smitten with Jim Stark (played by <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a>). His performance resulted in an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor, and his popularity quickly developed. Mineo's biographer, Paul Jeffers, recounted that Mineo received thousands of fan letters from young female admirers, was mobbed by them at public appearances and further wrote, ""He dated the most beautiful women in Hollywood and New York.""</p>   <p>Mineo played a Mexican boy in <em>Giant</em> (1956), again with James Dean along with Rock Hudson and Elizabeth Taylor. But many of his subsequent roles were variations of his role in <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, and he was typecast as a troubled teen.</p>   <p>In 1957, Mineo made a brief foray into music by recording a handful of songs and an album. Two of his singles reached the Top 40 pop charts. The more popular of the two, ""<em>Start Movin' (In My Direction)</em>"", reached #9 on Billboard's pop chart. He also starred as famed drummer Gene Krupa in the movie <em>The Gene Krupa Story</em>, co-starring Susan Kohner, James Darren, and Susan Oliver, and directed by Don Weis.</p>   <p>By the early 1960s, he was becoming too old to play the type of role that had made him famous and was not considered appropriate for leading roles. He auditioned for David Lean's film <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> but was not hired. Mineo was baffled by his sudden loss of popularity, later saying ""One minute it seemed I had more movie offers than I could handle, the next, no one wanted me.""</p>   <p>In the late 1960s, Sal realized he also was attracted to men and was probably the first major actor in Hollywood to publicly admit his homosexual lifestyle, and was a pioneer in paving the way for future generations of gay actors. </p>   <p>By 1976 Mineo's career had begun to turn around. Playing the role of a gay burglar in a San Francisco run of the stage comedy <em>P.S. Your Cat Is Dead</em>, he received substantial publicity from many positive reviews and moved on to Los Angeles with the play. Arriving home after a rehearsal on February 12, 1976, Mineo was stabbed to death in the alley behind his West Hollywood apartment building. He was 37 years old.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Murnau's <em>The Last Laugh</em> (<em>Der Letzte Mann</em>, 1924), as a proud but aged hotel doorman who is demoted to a restroom attendant, and in the 1922 film version of Shakespeare's <em>Othello</em>. Jannings worked with Murnau on two other films, playing the title character in <em>Herr TartÃ¼ff</em> (1925) and Mephistopheles in <em>Faust</em> (1926). He eventually started a career in Hollywood. In 1929 he won the Oscar for two films, <em>The Way of All Flesh</em> and <em>The Last Command</em>.<br/><br/>His Hollywood career came to an end with the advent of talkies; his thick German accent difficult to understand, and his dialogue was dubbed by another actor in the part-talkie <em>The Patriot</em> (1928), although after Jannings objected, his voice was restored. He returned to Europe, where he starred opposite Marlene Dietrich in the 1930 film <em>The Blue Angel</em>, filmed in English simultaneously with its German version <em>Der blaue Engel</em>.<br/><br/><br/>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

His performing style was brash and extroverted, and he popularized a large number of songs that benefited from his ""shamelessly sentimental, melodramatic approach"". Numerous well-known singers were influenced by his music, including Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, and Bob Dylan, who once referred to him as ""somebody whose life I can feel.""<br/><br/>By 1920, he was America's most famous and highest paid entertainer. Between 1911 and 1928, Jolson had nine sell-out Winter Garden shows in a row, more than 80 hit records, and 16 national and international tours. Yet he's best remembered today for his leading role in the first (full length) talking movie ever made, <em>The Jazz Singer</em>, released in 1927. He starred in a series of successful musical films throughout the 1930s. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned with the 1946 Oscar-winning biographical film, <em>The Jolson Story</em>. Larry Parks played Jolson with the songs dubbed in with Jolson's real voice. A sequel, <em>Jolson Sings Again</em>, was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops overseas during World War II, and again in 1950 became the first star to perform for GIs in Korea, doing 42 shows in 16 days.<br/><br/>According to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, ""Jolson was to jazz, blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll."" Being the first popular singer to make a spectacular ""event"" out of singing a song, he became a ""rock star"" before the dawn of rock music. His specialty was building stage runways extending out into the audience. He would run up and down the runway and across the stage, ""teasing, cajoling, and thrilling the audience,"" often stopping to sing to individual members, all the while the ""perspiration would be pouring from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the ecstasy of his performance.""<br/><br/>He enjoyed performing in blackface makeupâa theatrical convention in the early 20th century. With his unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American music to white audiences. As early as 1911, at the age of 25, he also became noted for fighting black discrimination on the Broadway stage. Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He was signed by Fox three years  later, in 1929, and received an Oscar nomination for his first film <em>The Valiant</em>. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">Muni  was nominated for a total of five Academy Awards, an impressive number  by any standard but all the more remarkable for Muni since he only  appeared in twenty-five films throughout his career. </p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">Muni  was widely recognized as an eccentric if talented individual. He would  go into a rage whenever anyone wore red, but at the same time he could  often be found between sessions relaxing with his violin. Over the  years, he also became increasingly dependent on his wife, Bella, who  terrified directors by forcing them to redo scenes that did not meet her  satisfaction.</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">A dispute with Warner  Bros. led to the termination of Muni's contract, the result of which was  stardom for Humphrey Bogart. Bogart had been bombarding studio head  Jack Warner with telegrams, begging to be cast as Roy Earle in the film <em>High Sierra</em>,  a part that was supposed to have been played by Muni. But after Muni's  departure from the studio, Warner told Bogart that the part was his  (according to rumor, he made the offer on condition that Bogart stop  sending him telegrams). After reigning as one of the biggest stars in  Hollywood during the 1930s, Muni only made eight films between 1941 and  1959 (including a guest appearance as himself in the 1943 film <em>Stage Door Canteen</em>).</p>   <p style=""font-size: 1em"">After  several failed projects, Muni made a triumphant return to Broadway,  winning a Tony Award in 1956 for the role of Henry Drummond in the play <em>Inherit the Wind</em>. He retired from filmmaking in 1959, soon after receiving his fifth Academy Award nomination for <em>The Last Angry Man</em>;  however, he made a final television appearance in the series Saints and  Sinners in 1962. Muni died in Montecito, California in 1967 at the age  of 71. Muni died the same year as his <em>Angel On My Shoulder</em> co-star Claude Rains. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6435 Hollywood Blvd.</p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">Â </p> <p style=""font-size: 1em"">All  Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

This success was followed by <em>Hold Back the Dawn</em> later that year. She was soon regarded as a witty, intelligent and trend-setting actress and had starring roles in more popular movies, including <em>Sullivan's Travels, This Gun for Hire, I Married a Witch, The Glass Key,</em> and <em>So Proudly We Hail!</em>. Looking back at her career years later, Lake remarked, ""I never did cheesecake; I just used my hair.""<br/><br/>For a short time during the early 1940s, Lake was considered one of the most reliable box office draws in Hollywood and was also known for her onscreen pairings with actor Alan Ladd. At first, the couple was teamed together merely out of physical necessity: Ladd was just 5 feet 5 inches tall and the only actress then on the Paramount lot short enough to pair with him was Lake, who stood just 4 feet 11Â½ inches. They made four films together.<br/><br/>A stray lock of her shoulder-length blonde hair during a publicity photo shoot led to her iconic 'peekaboo' hairstyle, which hid one eye, and was widely imitated. During World War II, she changed her trademark image to encourage women working in war industry factories to adopt more practical, safer hairstyles. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Lasting 14 seasons, it is among the longest running Western television series (behind <em>Gunsmoke</em>) and continues to air in syndication worldwide.</p>   <p><em>Bonanza</em> got its name from the Comstock Lode which was ""an exceptionally large and rich mineral deposit"" of silver. Virginia City was founded directly over the lode which was mined for 19 years. <em>Ponderosa</em> was an alternative title of the series, used for the broadcast of syndicated reruns while Bonanza was in first-run on NBC, and became the name of the 600,000 acre Sierra Nevada ranch featured in the series.</p>   <p>In 1959, the series aired on Saturday evenings opposite, <em>The Perry Como Hour</em>. <em>Bonanza </em>was one of the first series to be filmed and broadcast in color. RCA owned NBC (and the series) and wanted to use it to spur sales of color television sets. However, the Saturday night ratings were dismal and <em>Bonanza </em>was soon targeted for cancellation. Given one last chance, it was moved to Sunday nights at 9:00 PM. The new time slot caused the series to soar, and it eventually reached number one by the mid-'60s; by 1970, it had become the first series to ever wind up in the Top Five for nine consecutive seasons (a record which would stand for decades) and thus established itself as the single biggest hit TV series of the 1960s; it remained high on the Nielsen ratings until 1971, when it finally fell out of the top ten. </p> <p>Â <img alt=""Bonanza Cast"" height=""330"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/6B483853-3048-C0CE-557F792E339C16CA.jpg"" title=""Bonanza Cast"" width=""310""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Anton Lang, Anton,Lang,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/anton-lang-autograph-signed-signature-oberammergau-passion-play-jesus-christ/,Signed Passion Play Postcard,"  <p><strong>Signed postcard from the 1930 Oberammergau Passion Play, in which Lang played the lead role as Jesus Christ.<br/></strong></p> <p><strong>ANTON LANG</strong> (dates indeterminate) played Christ in a number of productions of the Oberammergau Passion Play in the early 20th centuryâ1900, 1910  and 1922.</p> <p>Oberammergau Passion Play is a passion play that has been performed every 10 years since 1634 as a tradition by the inhabitants of the village of Oberammergau in Bavaria in Germany. The town vowed that if God were to spare them from the effects of the bubonic plague ravaging the region, they would perform a play every ten years depicting the life and death of Jesus. The death rate among adults rose from one in October 1632 to twenty in the month of March 1633. The adult death rate slowly subsided to one in the month of July 1633. The villagers believed they were spared after they kept their part of the vow when the play was first performed in 1634. The most recent performances took place in 2000 and the next will be from May 15 until October 3, 2010.<br/><br/>The play, now performed repeatedly over the course of five months, during the last year of each decade, involves over 2,000 performers, musicians, and stage technicians, all of whom are residents of the village. It can be said that the evolution of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the Easter Play, originating in the ritual of the Latin Church, which prescribes, among other things, that the Gospel on Good Friday should be sung in parts divided among various persons.<br/><br/>The Oberammergau play has a running time of approximately seven hours. A meal is served during the intermission of the play. Audiences come from all over the world, often on package tours, the first instituted in 1870. Since 1930, the number of visitors has ranged from 420,000 to 530,000. <br/><br/>There were at least two years in which the scheduled performance did not take place. In 1770, Oberammergau was informed that all passion plays in Bavaria had been banned by order of the Ecclesiastical Council of the Elector, Maximillian Joseph at the behest of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1780, the play was retitled The Old and New Testament. The new Elector, Karl Theodor, having been assured that the play was ""purged of all objectionable and unseemly matter"" approved the performance of the play. By 1830, the Catholic Church succeeded in halting the performance of all other passion plays in Bavaria. Only Oberammergau remained. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Also signed on reverse by <em>Hunchback</em> director William Dieterle.</strong> From the collection of another actor of the same period.<br/><br/><strong>CHARLES LAUGHTON</strong> (1899-1962) was an Academy Award-winning English-American stage and film actor, screenwriter, producer and two-time director, who became an American citizen in 1950.<br/><br/>While best known for his historical roles in films, he started his career as a remarkable stage actor. During a time when many serious stage actors despised the motion picture medium, seeing it only as a source of income, Laughton showed keen and serious interest in the pioneering possibilities of film, and later other media, such as radio, recordings, and TV, proving that quality work could be made available to audiences other than theatre-goers. <br/><br/>Laughton's film roles in the 1930s were among his finest and consisted almost entirely of the costume and historical drama parts for which he is best remembered, among them <em>White Woman</em> (1933) in which he co-starred with Carole Lombard as a cockney river trader in the Malaysian jungle; <em>Les MisÃ©rables</em> (1935) as Javert, the police inspector; <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em> (1935) as Captain Bligh, one of his most famous screen roles, co-starring with Clark Gable as Fletcher Christian; <em></em>and <em>Jamaica Inn</em>, with Maureen O'Hara and Robert Newton, based on a novel about Cornish smugglers by Daphne du Maurier, and the last film Alfred Hitchcock directed in Britain before moving to Hollywood in the late 1930s. The films produced were not successful enough, and the company was saved from bankruptcy when RKO Pictures offered Laughton the title role of Quasimodo in <em>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</em> (1939). Laughton and Pommer had plans to make further films, but the outbreak of World War II, which implied the loss of many foreign markets, meant the end of the company.</p> <p>He would also star in an up-dated version of Oscar Wilde's <em>The Canterville Ghost</em> (1944), and in spite of Wilde's original flavor being mangled in order to turn the story into a piece of wartime propaganda, he was able to recover irony and weary melancholia of the character as Wilde originally devised him.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

She was born as Beatrice Gladys Lillie in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Following her marriage in 1920 to Sir Robert Peel, she was known in private life as Lady Peel.</p> <p>She was noted primarily for her stage work in revues, especially those staged by AndrÃ© Charlot, and light comedies, and was frequently paired with Gertrude Lawrence, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley. Beatrice (or Bea) Lillie, as she would be known professionally, took advantage of her gift for witty satire that made her a stage success for more than 50 years. In her revues, she utilized sketches, songs, and parody that won her lavish praise from the <em>New York Times</em> after her 1924 New York debut.</p> <p>Throughout her career as a revue performer, Lillie's contracts almost invariably stipulated that she would not make her first entrance onstage until at least half an hour into the show; by that point, every other act in the revue had made its first appearance and the audience would be keenly awaiting the entrance of Miss Lillie, the star of the evening.</p> <p>After seeing <em>An Evening with Beatrice Lillie</em>, British critic Ronald Barker wrote, ""Other generations may have their Mistinguett and their Marie Lloyd. We have our Beatrice Lillie and seldom have we seen such a display of perfect talent.""

He was chosen for the role of Q because of his work with director Terence Young in the 1950 war film <em>They Were Not Divided</em>, in which he played a tank gunner. Beginning with <em>From Russia with Love</em> in 1963, Llewelyn appeared as Q, the quartermaster of the MI6 gadget lab (also known as Q Branch), in almost every Bond film until his death, only missing an appearance in <em>Live and Let Die</em> in 1973.</p> <p>His last appearance as Q prior to his death was in <em>The World Is Not Enough</em> in 1999. During his briefing of 007 in the film, Q introduces John Cleese's character, R, as his heir presumptive, and the film alludes to Q's retirementâwhich Bond, after seeing R, expresses his hope that it will not be any time soon. Q's response is to admonish Bond to ""always have an escape plan"", after which he lowers himself through the floor of his lab. Llewelyn had stated not long before his death that he had no plans to retire and that he would continue playing Q ""as long as the producers want me and the Almighty doesn't.""</p> <p>In all, Llewelyn appeared in 17 Bond films, more than any other actor, and worked with the first five James Bond actors. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Carole Lombard, Carole,Lombard,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/carole-lombard-signed-autograph-signature/,Signed Autograph Card,"  <p><strong>Bold, florid </strong><strong>fountain pen </strong><strong>autograph in red ink on white paper.</strong></p> <p><strong>CAROLE LOMBARD</strong> (1908-1942) was an Oscar-nominated American actress. She was particularly noted for her comedic roles in several classic films of the 1930s. She is listed as one of the American Film Institute's greatest stars of all time. </p>   <p>Lombard's most famous relationship came in 1936 when she became involved with actor Clark Gable. They had worked together previously in 1932's <em>No Man of Her Own</em>, but at the time Lombard was still happily married to William Powell and Gable already had more women than he was willing to deal with. They were indifferent to each other on the set and did not keep in touch. It was not until 1936, when Gable came to the Mayfair Ball that Lombard had planned, that their romance began to take off. It was said that Gable and Lombard danced all night before disappearing. The disappearance, however, did not go further than driving around the block a few times, Lombard infuriating Gable, and not speaking to each other for the remainder of the evening. The following morning, Lombard sent Gable peace doves and their relationship took off in earnest. They still had to be quiet about their romance as Gable was still married to Ria Langham and a divorce would cost him a fortune. It was not until a scandalous article called <em>Hollywood's Unmarried Husbands and Wives</em> was printed in a fan magazine cited the Gable/Lombard romance in public that censorship chief and head of the Hayes Code Will Hayes went to Louis B. Mayer and demand he do something about contract stars Gable and Robert Taylor, who had also been mentioned in the article due to his relationship with Barbara Stanwyck. They were given a choice: to either marry the women or end their relationships. Both took the former route. This reason also proved a major factor in Gable accepting the role of Rhett Butler in <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, as Selznick wanted Gable so much for the part that he was willing to pay almost any price. Gable accepted the salary, but it still was not enough to keep him from losing the majority of his fortune. He divorced Langham on March 7, 1939 and proposed to Lombard in a telephone booth at Hollywood's Brown Derby. During a break in production on <em>Gone With the Wind</em>, Gable and Lombard were married on March 29. They bought a ranch previously owned by director Raoul Walsh in Encino, California and lived a happy, unpretentious life. To all who knew Gable, she was the love of his life.</p>   <p>Off-screen, Lombard was much loved for her unpretentious personality and well known for her earthy sense of humor and blue language. Friends of Lombard's included Marion Davies, William Haines, Jean Harlow, Fred MacMurray, Cary Grant, Jack Benny, William Powell and Lucille Ball.</p>   <p>Shortly after her death at the age of 33, Gable (who was inconsolable and devastated by her loss) joined the United States Army Air Forces, serving primarily in Public Affairs but on occasion flew aboard bombers on combat missions.

In the last years of his career he featured in several of Ed Wood's low budget films.<br/><br/>Lugosi was approached in the summer of 1927 to star in a Broadway production of Dracula adapted by Hamilton Deane and John L. Balderston from Bram Stoker's novel. The Horace Liveright production was successful, running 261 performances before touring. He was soon called to Hollywood for character parts in early talkies.<br/><br/>Despite his critically acclaimed performance on stage, Lugosi was not Universal Pictures' first choice for the role of <em>Dracula</em> when the company optioned the rights to the Deane play and began production in 1930. A persistent rumor asserts that director Tod Browning's long-time collaborator <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/lon-chaney-jr-signed-autograph-signature-on-album-page-wolfman"">Lon Chaney</a> was Universal's first choice for the role, and that Lugosi was chosen only due to Chaney's death shortly before production. This is questionable, because Chaney had been under long-term contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer since 1925, and had negotiated a lucrative new contract just before his death. Following the success of Dracula, Lugosi received a studio contract with Universal.<br/><br/><em>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein</em> was Bela Lugosi's last ""A"" movie. For the remainder of his life he appeared-less and less frequently-in relatively obscure, low-budget features. Late in his life, Bela Lugosi again received star billing in movies when filmmaker Edward D. Wood, Jr., a fan of Lugosi, found him living in obscurity and near-poverty and offered him roles in his films, such as Glen or Glenda and as a Dr. Frankenstein-like mad scientist in <em>Bride of the Monster</em>. During post-production of the latter, Lugosi decided to seek treatment for his addiction, and the premiere of the film was said to be intended to help pay for his hospital expenses. According to Kitty Kelley's biography of Frank Sinatra, when the entertainer heard of Lugosi's problems, he helped with expenses and visited at the hospital. Lugosi would recall his amazement, since he didn't even know Sinatra.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Discovered while on stage at the Pasadena Community Playhouse, his first leading role was as a fur-clad caveman in <em>One Million B.C.</em> (1940), after which he joined 20th Century Fox to star opposite actresses such as <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/betty-grable-autograph-signed-signature-pin-up-girl-down-argentine-way"" target=""_blank"">Betty Grable</a> and Rita Hayworth.<br/><br/>After World War II, Mature was cast by John Ford in <em>My Darling Clementine</em>, playing Doc Holliday opposite Henry Fonda's Wyatt Earp. For the next decade, Mature settled into playing hard-boiled characters in a range of genres such as Westerns and Biblical films, such as <em>The Robe</em> (with Richard Burton and Jean Simmons) and its popular sequel, <em>Demetrius and the Gladiators</em> (with Susan Hayward). Both films deal with the fate of the robe worn by Jesus before the crucifixion. Mature also starred with Hedy Lamarr in Cecil B. DeMille's Bible epic, <em>Samson and Delilah</em> (1949) and as Horemheb in <em>The Egyptian</em> (1954) with Jean Simmons and Gene Tierney. He reportedly stated he was successful in Biblical epics because he could ""make with the holy look"".<br/><br/>He also starred with Esther Williams in <em>Million Dollar Mermaid</em> (1952), and had a romantic relationship with her according to her autobiography. Mature was famously modest about his acting skill. Once, after being rejected for membership in a country club because he was an actor, he cracked, ""I'm not an actor-and I've got 67 films to prove it!"" (Another account has him saying either ""...and I've got a scrapbook of reviews to prove it!"" or ""Have you seen any of my films?"") He has been quoted as commenting on his acting career: ""Actually, I am a golfer. That is my real occupation. I never was an actor. Ask anybody, particularly the critics.""</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

After appearing in the 1974 film <em>The Towering Inferno</em>, he became the highest paid movie star in the world. Although McQueen was combative with directors and producers, his popularity put him in high demand and enabled him to command large salaries.<br/><br/>McQueen's first breakout role would not come in film, but in television, for a new series titled <em>Wanted: Dead or Alive</em>, on CBS in September 1958. He had a series of big films following which made him a household name and a highly bankable movie star: <em>Never So Few</em> with Frank Sinatra; <em>The Magnificent Seven</em> with a cast of major stars including Yul Brynner; <em>The Great Escape</em>; <em>Love With the Proper Stranger</em> with Natalie Wood; <em>The Carpetbaggers</em>; <em>The Sand Pebbles</em>; and ultimately one of the roles for which he is best remembered, <em>Bullitt</em>. McQueen was an avid racer of both motorcycles and cars.

He made a reported 336 films between 1910 and 1935, all but nine of which were silent features. He was Hollywood's first Western megastar and is noted as having defined the genre for all cowboy actors who followed.</p>   <p>Tom Mix did all his own tricks and he and Tony, ""The Wonder Horse"" made 181 movies together. The Mix films were loaded with fantastic stunts, furious shootouts, romance, and were set in beautiful, colorful western locations such as Lone Pine, California, and always manifested an element of comedy. Tony, with his white stocking rear feet, became the most popular, photographed and recognized horse in the world, receiving thousands of fan letters from children around the world. With Tom Mix astride Tony, the action packed duo earned millions.</p>   <p>The Great Depression (along with the actor's free spending ways and many wives) had reportedly wiped out most of his savings. Universal Pictures approached him in 1932 with an offer to do talkies which included script and cast approval. He did 9 pictures for Universal, but because of injuries he received while filming he was reluctant to continue with any more. Mix then appeared with the Sam B. Dill circus, which he reportedly bought two years later (1935). In 1933 Ralston (later to become Ralston-Purina) obtained his permission to produce a Tom Mix radio series, <em>Tom Mix Ralston Straight Shooters</em>, which, except for one year during World War II, was popular throughout most of the 1930s and into the early 1950s. (Mix never appeared on these broadcasts and was instead played by voice actors.) He formed the <strong>Tom Mix Straight Shooters Club of America,</strong> the world-famous radio series that ran from the early 1930s for nearly 20 years. ""Straight Shooters"" were given a special manual to learn the secret handshake and secret password of the club, and they received other premiums such as ""TM rings made from lucky horseshoe nails"", and official ""Straight Shooter Badges"" identifying club members.</p>   <p>Mix's last screen appearance was a 15 episode serial for Mascot Pictures called The Miracle Rider (1935), for which he was paid $40,000 for four weeks of filming. He had reportedly made over $6,000,000 (approaching $400 million in early 21st century, inflation adjusted values) during his 26 year career in the movies.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Once in America, Modjeska and her husband purchased a ranch near Anaheim, California, making her one of the pioneering residents of Orange County, California. Modjeska's home from 1888 to 1906, ""Arden,"" in what is now known as Modjeska Canyon, is a registered National Historic Landmark.

One of the finest Shakespearean actresses of her day, she played numerous Shakespearean roles as well as other classic and contemporary roles with her company, which toured nine months a year, playing across America on stages from New York City and across the country in many rural venues.

 Marilyn Monroe, Marilyn,Monroe,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rare-marilyn-monroe-photo-laszlo-willinger-all-about-eve/,Vintage Photo Inscribed,"  <p>This is an extremely rare and stunning original early portrait of a demure Marilyn Monroe sitting in the elegant strapless satin brocade gown she wore in <em>All About Eve</em>âthe epitome of beauty, grace, and glamourâtaken by photographer Laszlo Willinger in 1950 when she was just 24. The florid inscription and signature, likely in the hand of Marilyn's secretary, is in bright red ink that reads, <strong>""Marguerite, Gratefully, Marilyn Monroe.""</strong> Though its path in history isn't clear, <em>""Marguerite""</em> is most likely <a href=""http://margueritechapman.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""Marguerite Chapman"">Marguerite Chapman</a>, who played the secretary in Marilyn's memorable film <em>The Seven Year Itch</em>. That film premiered on June 1, 1955, Marilyn's 29th birthday.</p> <p>Monroe's photos typically had inscriptions such as ""Best of luck,"" ""Hugs and kisses,"" ""Thinking of you"" and similar, more generalized expressionsâbut ""<em>Gratefully</em>"" implies a closer relationship, which is what led us to <a href=""http://www.margueritechapman.com/"" target=""_blank"">Marguerite Chapman</a>. After her own long film career Ms. Chapman passed away in 1999, but her family has confirmed with us that she did in fact once own a signed image of Marilyn Monroe, though she had to sell much of her memorabilia over the years to provide for herselfâestablishing a logical and highly relevant provenance with Marilyn Monroe's film career. </p> <p>Featured in Marie Clayton's wonderful book <em>Marilyn Monroe: Unseen Archives</em>, this rarely seen photograph was taken when Marilyn was still known as ""Norma Jeane Mortenson,"" just one of hundreds of aspiring young starlets seeking fame and fortune in Hollywood's Golden Era. One can sense in this portrait the vulnerability and innocence that marked Marilyn's film careerâan image that shaped itself over the next decade to become a dominant box office drawâestablishing Marilyn Monroe as one of the most memorable women of the 20th century and beyond. </p> <p>This beautiful original photograph comes from the collection of the late Leon Becker, once among the world's foremost historical autograph dealers whose renowned gallery, Memorabilia, Ltd., was located in Rancho La Costa, California. Marilyn's image is tastefully displayed in the beautiful archival mounting Leon's talented design staff created in the 1980s: the glossy 8x10 photo is bordered with an acid-free black mat beneath a rich pink brocade silk lining, which itself is bordered again by a thin black moire and finished with a top mat wrapped in a golden cream moire fabric, encased in a brushed silver-finished 21x17 wooden frame.

The finest materials were used in framing this fitting display: cocoa-themed Italian hand-marbled papers in a peacock motif border each windowed element, the top mat is lined with chocolate linen, all neatly positioned inside a cross-hatch brushed silver wooden frame.</strong></p>   <p>The photo featured is from the famous ""Young Lion"" black-and-white series taken by Joel Brodskyâthe same shot that was featured on the cover of the <em>Best of the Doors</em> LP in 1973 (released posthumously). Be sure to view this close-up in Zoom modeâBrodsky's photograph is mesmerizing, as was Jim's persona. </p> <p>Jim Morrison was an American singer, poet, songwriter, writer, and film director. Best known as the lead singer and lyricist of The Doors, Morrison is widely considered to be one of the most charismatic and influential front men in rock music history. He was also the author of several books of poetry, and the director of a documentary and short film.</p> <p>Morrison died on July 3, 1971, far too young, at age 27. In the official account of his death, he was found in a Paris apartment bathtub by his girlfriend Pamela Courson. Pursuant to French law, no autopsy was performed because the medical examiner claimed to have found no evidence of foul play. The absence of an official autopsy has left many questions regarding Morrison's cause of death.</p>   <p>Because of his short life, and shorter fame when he was alive, Jim Morrison is among the more highly sought-after autographs since, much like <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/james-dean-signed-east-of-eden-lobby-card-autographed-signature-memorabilia"">James Dean</a>, he was famous for a relatively short time before he died.

His performing style was brash and extroverted,  and he popularized a large number of songs that benefited from his  ""shamelessly sentimental, melodramatic approach"". Numerous well-known  singers were influenced by his music, including Bing Crosby, Judy  Garland, and Bob Dylan, who once referred to him as ""somebody whose life  I can feel.""<br/><br/>By 1920, he was America's most famous and highest  paid entertainer. Between 1911 and 1928, Jolson had nine sell-out Winter  Garden shows in a row, more than 80 hit records, and 16 national and  international tours. Yet he's best remembered today for his leading role  in the first (full length) talking movie ever made, <em>The Jazz Singer</em>,  released in 1927. He starred in a series of successful musical films  throughout the 1930s. After a period of inactivity, his stardom returned  with the 1946 Oscar-winning biographical film, <em>The Jolson Story</em>. Larry Parks played Jolson with the songs dubbed in with Jolson's real voice. A sequel, <em>Jolson Sings Again</em>,  was released in 1949, and was nominated for three Oscars. After the  attack on Pearl Harbor, Jolson became the first star to entertain troops  overseas during World War II, and again in 1950 became the first star  to perform for GIs in Korea, doing 42 shows in 16 days.<br/><br/>According  to the St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture, ""Jolson was to jazz,  blues, and ragtime what Elvis Presley was to rock 'n' roll."" Being the  first popular singer to make a spectacular ""event"" out of singing a  song, he became a ""rock star"" before the dawn of rock music. His  specialty was building stage runways extending out into the audience. He  would run up and down the runway and across the stage, ""teasing,  cajoling, and thrilling the audience,"" often stopping to sing to  individual members, all the while the ""perspiration would be pouring  from his face, and the entire audience would get caught up in the  ecstasy of his performance.""<br/><br/>He enjoyed performing in blackface  makeupâa theatrical convention in the early 20th century. With his  unique and dynamic style of singing black music, like jazz and blues, he  was later credited with single-handedly introducing African-American  music to white audiences. As early as 1911, at the age of 25, he also  became noted for fighting black discrimination on the Broadway stage.  Jolson's well-known theatrics and his promotion of equality on Broadway  helped pave the way for many black performers, playwrights, and  songwriters, including Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington,  Fats Waller, and Ethel Waters.</p><p style=""font-size: 1em"">Â </p><p style=""font-size: 1em"">All  Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be  genuine.

 Alla Nazimova, Alla,Nazimova,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/alla-nazimova-nasimoff-signature-autograph/,Signed Album Page,"  <p><strong>Signed autograph album page. Boldly signed in pencil, circa 1936.</strong></p> <p><strong>Alla Nazimova</strong> (1879-1945), was a Russian American film and theatre actress, a screenwriter and film producer. She is perhaps best known as simply Nazimova, but also went under the name Alia Nasimoff.</p> <p>Nazimova's theater career blossomed early; by 1903 she was a major star in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. She toured Europe, including London and Berlin, with her boyfriend Pavel Orlenev, a flamboyant actor and producer. In 1905 they moved to New York City and founded a Russian-language theater on the Lower East Side. The venture was unsuccessful; and Orlenev returned to Russia while Nazimova stayed in New York.</p> <p>She was signed up by the American producer Henry Miller and made her Broadway debut in New York City, New York, in 1906 to critical and popular success. She quickly became extremely popular (a theater was named after her) and remained a major Broadway star for years, often acting in the plays of Henrik Ibsen and Anton Chekhov. Dorothy Parker described her as the finest Hedda Gabler she had ever seen.</p> <p>Between the years of 1917 and 1922 Nazimova wielded considerable influence and power in Hollywood. By all accounts she was extremely generous to young actresses in whom she saw talent and became involved with at least some of them romantically. For instance, after meeting a young Patsy Ruth Miller at a Hollywood party, Nazimova assisted in getting Miller's career launched. Another noteworthy example was Anna May Wong, whose first film role at age 14 was as an extra in <em>The Red Lantern</em>. From 1912 to 1925 Nazimova lived in a ""lavender marriage"" with Charles Bryant, a New York actor.</p> <p>Nazimova helped start the careers of both of Rudolph Valentino's wives, Jean Acker and Natacha Rambova. Although she was involved in an affair with Acker, it is debated as to whether her connection with Rambova ever developed into a sexual affair.Â </p> <p>Of those Nazimova is confirmed to have been involved with romantically, the list includes actress Eva Le Gallienne, director Dorothy Arzner, writer Mercedes de Acosta, and Oscar Wilde's niece, Dolly Wilde. Bridget Bate Tichenor, a Magic Realist artist and Surrealist painter, was also rumored to be one of Nazimova's favored lovers in Hollywood during the World War II years of 1940 to 1942. The two had been introduced by the poet and art collector Edward James, and according to Tichenor, their intimate relationship angered Nazimova's longtime companion, Glesca Marshall. It was allegedly Nazimova who coined the phrase ""sewing circles"" as code to refer to lesbian or bisexual actresses of her day who concealed their true sexuality.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><img alt=""Alla Nazimova"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_30BD431D-1517-6111-28D02ABDCDC21666.jpg"" title=""Alla Nazimova"" width=""178""/> </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Parsons then moved to New York and started working for the <em>New York Morning Telegraph</em> writing a similar movie column, which attracted the attention of Hearst. In 1922, after some shrewd bargaining on both sides, she signed a contract and joined the Hearst newspaper the <em>New York American</em>.</p>   <p>In 1925, Parsons contracted tuberculosis and was told she had six months to live. She moved to Arizona for the change in climate, then to Los Angeles, where she decided to stay. With the disease in remission, she went back to work, becoming a syndicated Hollywood columnist for Hearst. As she and the publishing mogul had developed an ironclad relationship, her <em>Los Angeles Examiner</em> column came to appear in over six hundred newspapers the world over, with a readership of more than twenty-million, and Parsons gradually became one of the most powerful voices in the movie business with her daily allotment of gossip. According to Hearst's mistress and protegÃ© Marion Davies in her posthumously published memoirs <em>The Times We Had</em>, Parsons had encouraged readers to ""give this girl a chance"" while the majority of critics disparaged Davies; it was on this basis that Hearst hired Parsons.</p>   <p>Beginning in 1928, she hosted a weekly radio program featuring movie star interviews that was sponsored by SunKist. A similar program in 1931 was sponsored by Charis Foundation Garment. In 1934, she signed a contract with the Campbell's Soup Company and began hosting a program titled <em>Hollywood Hotel</em>, which showcased stars in scenes from their upcoming movies.</p>   <p>Parsons was especially known for her uncanny ability to scoop her competitors with the juiciest stories and for knowing all the secrets of everyone in screendom. She was associated with various Hearst enterprises for the rest of her career. Parsons established herself as the social and moral arbiter of Hollywood. Her judgments were considered the final word in most cases, and her disfavor was feared more than that of movie critics. Her column was followed religiously and thus afforded her a unique type and degree of power. Her formidable power remained unchallenged until 1937, when Hedda Hopper, a struggling character actress since the days of silent movies, whom Parsons had been kind to and mentioned occasionally in her column, and who had returned the favor by giving Parsons information on others, was hired to be a gossip columnist by one of Hearst's rival newspapers. Parsons and Hopper then became arch-rivals and had a notorious feud.</p>   <p>Parsons also appeared in numerous cameo spots in movies, including <em>Hollywood Hotel</em> (1937), <em>Without Reservations</em> (1946) and <em>Starlift</em> (1951). She was caricatured in Frank Tashlin's 1937 cartoon <em>The Woods are Full of Cuckoos</em> as ""Louella Possums"".</p>   <p>In 1944, she wrote her memoirs, <em>The Gay Illiterate</em>, published by Doubleday, Doran and Company, which became a bestseller. That was followed by another volume in 1961, <em>Tell It To Louella</em>, published by G.P. Putnam's Sons.</p>  ",1944,100,0,FALSE,3375,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/5970277A-1517-6111-281727D134C04A3B.jpg,

Her motion picture debut was in <em>Battle of Hearts</em> (1916). She appeared in more than 120 movies over the following twenty-three years, usually portraying distinguished-looking society women.</p>   <p>As her movie career waned in the mid-1930s, Hopper looked for other sources of income. In 1937, she was offered the chance of a lifetime and embarked on a career doing something she was quite adept at: gossip. Her gossip column called ""<em>Hedda Hopper's Hollywood</em>"" debuted in the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> on February 14, 1938. After years of struggling as an actress, she had finally found her niche. She christened the home she purchased in Beverly Hills ""The House That Fear Built."" She then had a notorious feud with the long-established <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/louella-parsons-autograph-note-signed-signature-mary-margaret-mcBride"">Louella Parsons</a>, who had been friendly to her in print and to whom she had sometimes passed information. Hopper and Parsons became archrivals competing fiercely, and often nastily, for the title ""Queen of Hollywood"", although those who knew both declared that Hopper was the more sadistic.</p>   <p>She was noted for her hats, considered her trademark, mostly because of her taste for large, flamboyant ones; and her hats were so famous that, in the 1946 movie, <em>Breakfast in Hollywood</em>, Del Porter, backed by Spike Jones and his City Slickers, even sang a novelty song entitled ""<em>A Hat for Hedda Hopper</em>"", to Hedda Hopper who was sitting in the audience wearing an extraordinary creation.</p>   <p>She was known for hobnobbing with the biggest names in the industry, for getting a ""scoop"" before almost anyone else most of the time, and for being vicious in dealing with those who displeased her, whether intentionally or not. The columnist J.J. Hunsecker, played by Burt Lancaster in the film <em>Sweet Smell of Success</em>, is said to have been inspired partly by Hopper.</p>   <p>Hopper courted controversy as well for ""naming names"" of suspected or alleged Communists during the Hollywood Blacklist. Her frequent attacks against Charlie Chaplin in the 1940s for his leftist politics and love life contributed to his departure from America in 1952. After publishing a blind item on Katharine Hepburn and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/spencer-tracy-autograph-signed-signature-san-francisco-mgm"">Spencer Tracy</a>'s relationship, Tracy confronted her at Ciro's and kicked her in the behind. A similar incident occurred when Hopper leaked info about the extramarital affair between Joseph Cotten and Deanna Durbin. She tried to ""out"" <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/cary-grant-signed-vintage-photo-autographed-inscribed-signature"">Cary Grant</a> and Randolph Scott as gay lovers, but Grant was too big a star even for her to touch. She also spread rumors that Michael Wilding and Stewart Granger had been intimate (Wilding later sued Hopper for libel and won). ZaSu Pitts compared Hopper to ""a ferret"", and pointed out that she should not have been surprised her (Hopper's) own movie career did not pan out. Joan Fontaine sent Hopper a skunk on Valentine's Day with a note reading ""I stink and so do you"".</p>   <p>Having spent years with her own programs on radio for various networks, on January 10, 1960, a TV special, <em>Hedda Hopper's Hollywood</em>, aired on NBC. Hosted by Hopper, guest interviews included an extremely eclectic mix of then-current and former stars: Lucille Ball (a longtime friend of Hopper), Francis X. Bushman, Liza Minnelli, John Cassavetes, Robert Cummings, Marion Davies (her last public appearance), Walt Disney, Janet Gaynor, Bob Hope, Hope Lange, Anthony Perkins, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart and Gloria Swanson.</p>   <p>Hopper also had several acting roles during the latter part of her career, including brief cameo appearances as herself in the movie <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> (1950) and <em>The Patsy</em> (1964), as well as episodes of <em>I Love Lucy</em> and <em>The Beverly Hillbillies</em>. Her autobiography, From <em>Under My Hat</em> (Doubleday, 1952) was followed by <em>The Whole Truth and Nothing But</em> (1962), also published by Doubleday.</p>   <p>Hopper remained active as a writer until her death, producing six daily columns and a Sunday column for the <em>Chicago Tribune</em> syndicate, as well as writing countless articles for celebrity magazines such as <em>Photoplay</em>. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Hopper has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6313 1/2 Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Making his film debut with the Essanay Studios in Chicago, he moved to Hollywood in 1911 and starred in over 170 films throughout his career. He was a very versatile actor, often playing multiple roles in a single production, as when he played two leading characters, the count and the crook, in the 1916 production of <em>The Counterfeit Earl</em>. The story of Norma Desmond, though fictitious, is not far removed from the plight of many silent film stars, and the advent of the sound film brought about a swift end to Periolat's career. He made his last appearance in 1932's <em>What Price Hollywood?</em>. On February 20, 1940, he committed suicide by ingesting arsenic in his Hollywood mansion.     </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Though famous for his dark, classically handsome looks that made him a matinee idol from his first film appearance, Power played a wide range of roles, from film noir to light romantic comedy. In the 1950s, he began placing limits on the number of movies he would make in order to have time for the stage.

Having died at just 21 years old, Eddie Cochran remains one of the most sought after rock autographs in entertainment history, especially considering his impact on so many rock and roll giants who came after him.</p>   <p>His most famous hit, ""Summertime Blues"" was an important influence on music in the late 1950s, both lyrically and musically. Released on Liberty Records, the song charted #8 on August 25, 1958. Cochran's brief career included only a few more hits, such as ""C'mon Everybody"", ""Somethin' Else"", ""My Way"", ""Weekend"", ""Teenage Heaven"", ""Sitting in the Balcony"", ""Three Stars"", ""Nervous Breakdown"", and his posthumous UK number one hit ""Three Steps to Heaven.""</p>   <p>One of the first rock &amp; roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks, Cochran is credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string, in order to ""bend"" notes up a whole toneâan innovation which has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary. Artists such as The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Van Halen, Tom Petty, Rod Stewart, The Who, The Beach Boys, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Buck Owens, Dion, Paul McCartney, and Jimi Hendrix, among countless others, have covered his songs. Hendrix performed ""Summertime Blues"" early in his career and Pete Townshend of The Who was heavily influenced by Cochran's guitar style. </p>   <p>Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British Label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than had been released during his life. One of his posthumous releases was ""Three Stars,"" a tribute to J.P. Richardson, better known as The Big Bopper, and Eddie's friends Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens, who had all died together in a plane crash just one year earlier. It was originally written and recorded by Tommy Dee just hours after the deaths were officially reported, and Cochran recorded his version the day after. His voice broke during the lyrics about Valens and Holly.</p>   <p>On Saturday, April 16, 1960, at about 11:50 p.m., while on tour in the United Kingdom, 21-year-old Cochran died in a traffic accident in a taxi in Chippenham, Wiltshire, about a hundred miles (163 km) west of London. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the <a href=""http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/eddie-cochran"">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>. The Rockabilly Hall of Fame has also recognized his pioneering contribution to rockabilly. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

From the end of 1954 until the end of 1956 the group would place nine singles into the Top 20, one of those a number one and three more in the Top Ten.</p>   <p>Bandleader Bill Haley had previously been a country performer; after recording a country and western-styled version of ""Rocket 88"", a rhythm and blues song, he changed musical direction to a new sound that came to be called rock and roll.</p>   <p>Although several members of the Comets became famous, Bill Haley remained the star.

It was a minor role, but he and Fred Crane, both in brightly dyed red hair as ""the Tarleton Twins,"" were in the film's opening scenes. He was contracted to Warner Brothers at the time, and the actor's professional name became ""George Reeves"" and his <em>GWTW</em> screen credit reflects the change.</p>   <p>In June 1951, Reeves was offered the role of Superman in a new television series. He was initially reluctant to take the role because, like many actors of his time, he considered television unimportant and believed few would see his work. He received low pay and only for the weeks of production. The half-hour films were shot on tight schedules; at least two shows were made every six days.</p> <p>Â <img alt=""George Reeves in Superman and the Mole Men"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_3522FF61-1517-6111-28E3288E02212596.jpg"" title=""George Reeves in Superman and the Mole Men"" width=""234""/></p>   <p>Reeves's career as Superman had begun with <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KinXCr3S18"" target=""_blank""><em>Superman and the Mole Men</em></a>, a film intended both as a B-picture and as the pilot for the TV series. Immediately after completing it, Reeves and the crew began production of the first season's episodes, all shot over 13 weeks in the summer of 1951. The series went on the air the following year, and Reeves was amazed at becoming a national celebrity. In 1957, the struggling ABC Network purchased the show for national broadcast, which gave him greater visibility.</p>   <p>In the 104 episodes, Reeves showed gentlemanly behavior to his fellow actors. Larson, who played Jimmy Olsen, recalled that Reeves enjoyed playing practical jokes on the crew and cast, as depicted during a scene in the biopic <em>Hollywoodland</em>. Reeves insisted his original Lois Lane, Phyllis Coates, be given equal billing in the credits. When Coates was replaced by Noel Neill, Reeves defended her nervousness on her first day when he felt that the director was being too harsh with her. On the other hand, he liked to stand outside camera range, mugging at the other cast members to see if he could break them up. According to Larson, Reeves took on-set photos with his Minox and handed out prints. By all accounts, there was strong camaraderie among the show's actors.</p>   <p>After two seasons, Reeves was dissatisfied with the one-dimensional role and low salary. Now 40 years old, he wished to quit and move on with his career. The producers looked elsewhere for a new star, allegedly contacting Kirk Alyn, the actor who had first portrayed Superman in the original movie serials and who had initially refused to play the role on television. Alyn turned them down again.</p>   <p>By mid 1959, contracts were signed, costumes refitted, and new teleplay writers assigned. Noel Neill was quoted as saying that the cast of Superman was ready to do a new series of the still-popular show. Producers reportedly promised Reeves that the new programs would be as serious and action-packed as the first season, guaranteed him creative input, and slated him to direct several of the new shows as he had done with the final three episodes of the 1957 season. In the documentary <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeGR65A9T-Q"" target=""_blank""><em>Look, Up in the Sky: The Amazing Story of Superman</em></a>, Neill remembered that Reeves was excited to go back to work. Jack Larson, however, told biographer Jim Beaver, ""Anyone who thought another season of Superman would make George Reeves happy, didn't know George.""</p>   <p>His death at age 45 from a gunshot remains a polarizing issue. Some believe the official verdict of suicide; others believe George Reeves was murdered or the victim of an accidental shooting.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He had his pick of numerous Ivy League schools for which he had been accepted and chose Cornell, joining the theater department and acting in a number of well-received plays. In the fall of his freshman year, Reeve received a letter from Stark Hesseltine, a high-powered agent who had discovered Robert Redford and represented such actors as Michael Douglas, Susan Sarandon and Richard Chamberlain. Hesseltine had seen Reeve in <em>A Month in the Country</em> at Harvard Summer Repertory Theater when he was just 16, and wanted to represent him. The two met and decided that instead of dropping out of school, Reeve could come to New York once a month to meet casting agents and producers to find work for the summer vacation.</p>   <p>In 1973, around two thousand students auditioned for twenty places in the freshman class at the famed Juilliard School. Reeve's audition was in front of ten faculty members, including John Houseman, who had just won an Academy Award for <em>The Paper Chase</em>. Reeve and fellow actor Robin Williams were the only students selected for Juilliard's Advanced Program.</p>   <p>After countless productions that garnered him great reviews and lots of attention, agent Stark Hesseltine told Reeve that he had been asked to audition for the leading role as Clark Kent/Superman in the big budget film, <em>Superman: The Movie</em> (1978). Lynn Stalmaster, the casting director, put Reeve's picture and resume on the top of the pile three separate times, only to have the producers throw it out each time. Through Stalmaster's persistent pleading, a meeting between director Richard Donner, producer Ilya Salkind and Reeve was set in January 1977 at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel on Fifth Avenue. The morning after the meeting, Reeve was sent a 300-page script. He was thrilled that the script took the subject matter seriously, and that Richard Donner's motto was <em>verisimilitude</em>. Reeve immediately flew to London for a screen test, and on the way was told that Marlon Brando was going to play Jor-El and Gene Hackman was going to play Lex Luthor. Reeve still did not think he had much of a chance. After the screen test, his driver said, ""I'm not supposed to tell you this, but you've got the part.""</p>   <p>Reeve was a talented all-around athlete. Portraying the role of Superman would be a stretch for the young actor, but he was tall enough for the role and had the necessary blue eyes and handsome features. However, his physique was slim. He refused to wear fake muscles under the suit, and instead went through an intense two-month training regimen supervised by former British weightlifting champion David Prowse, the man under the Darth Vader suit in the <em>Star Wars</em> films. The training regime consisted of running in the morning, followed by two hours of weightlifting and ninety minutes on the trampoline. In addition, Reeve doubled his food intake and adopted a high protein diet. He put on thirty pounds of muscle to his thin 190-pound frame. He later made even higher gains for <em>Superman III</em> (1983), though for <em>Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</em> (1987) he decided it would be healthier to focus more on cardiovascular workouts.</p>   <p>Reeve was never a Superman or comic book fan, though he had watched <em>Adventures of Superman</em> starring <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/george-reeves-superman-signed-autograph-signature"">George Reeves</a>. However, he found that the role offered a suitable challenge because it was a dual role. He said, ""There must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise, you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character."" He based his portrayal of Clark Kent on <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/cary-grant-signed-vintage-photo-autographed-inscribed-signature"">Cary Grant</a> in his role in <em>Bringing up Baby</em>.</p>   <p>Following the first <em>Superman</em> movie, Reeve found that Hollywood producers wanted him to be an action star. He later said, ""I found most of the scripts of that genre poorly constructed, and I felt the starring roles could easily be played by anyone with a strong physique."" In addition, he did not feel that he was right for the other films he was offered, and turned down the lead roles in <em>American Gigolo</em>, <em>The World According to Garp</em>, <em>Splash</em>, <em>Fatal Attraction</em>, <em>Pretty Woman</em>, <em>Romancing the Stone</em>, <em>Lethal Weapon</em> and <em>Body Heat</em>. His close friend Katharine Hepburn recommended Reeve to director Roger Donaldson for the role of Fletcher Christian in a remake of <em>Mutiny on the Bounty</em> entitled <em>The Bounty</em>, starring Anthony Hopkins.

He trained at Martha's Vineyard, and by 1989 he began eventing.

His stage and subsequent film career spanned a total of seventy-six years, during which he made thirty-one musical films. He is particularly associated with <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/ginger-rogers-autograph-signed-signature-fred-astaire"" target=""_blank"">Ginger Rogers</a>, with whom he made ten films.</p>   <p>Fred Astaire is generally acknowledged to have been one of the most influential dancers in the history of film and television musicals. He was named the fifth Greatest Male Star of All Time by the American Film Institute.</p>   <p>Astaire was a virtuoso dancer, able to convey light-hearted abandon or deep emotion when called for. His technical control and sense of rhythm were astonishing. Long after the photography for the solo dance number ""I Want To Be A Dancin' Man"" was completed for the 1952 feature <em>The Belle Of New York</em>, it was decided that Astaire's humble costume and the threadbare stage set were inadequate and the entire sequence was re-shot. The 1994 documentary <em>That's Entertainment! III</em> shows the two performances side-by-side in split screen. Frame for frame, the two performances are absolutely identical, down to the subtlest gesture.</p>   <p>Astaire's execution of a dance routine was prized for its elegance, grace, originality and precision. He drew from a variety of influences, including tap and other black rhythms, classical dance and the elevated style of Vernon and Irene Castle, to create a uniquely recognizable dance style which greatly influenced the American Smooth style of ballroom dance, and set standards against which subsequent film dance musicals would be judged. He termed his eclectic approach his ""outlaw style"", an unpredictable and instinctive blending of personal artistry. </p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Scott's Tarzan films ranged from rather cheap re-edited television pilots to larger scale epics. Two of them, <em>Tarzan's Greatest Adventure</em> and <em>Tarzan the Magnificent</em> are generally considered to be among the very best Tarzan films ever made. Scott's (and his writers') particular gifts to the series included returning Tarzan to his former status as a literate, well-spoken character. Following his departure from the Tarzan films, he moved to Italy and became a popular star of what were known as ""sword and sandal"" epics, featuring handsome bodybuilders as various characters from Greek and Roman myth. Scott was a friend of Hercules star Steve Reeves, and collaborated with him as Remus to Reeves' Romulus in <em>Duel of the Titans</em> (1961). Scott also played Hercules in a couple of low-budget productions during the mid-1960s. His final film appearance was in <em>The Tramplers</em>, filmed in 1966, released in the U.S. in 1968. Scott was married apparently three times, including once to his Tarzan co-star, actress Vera Miles, from 1954 to 1959.   </p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Marginal creases could be retouched, else very good. Inscribed to Mariano Soyer, a portrait artist whose works included many of Hollywood's stars of the Forties, including Grant.</strong></p> <p><strong></strong><strong>ARCHIBALD LEACH </strong>(1904-1986), better known by his stage name, <strong>CARY GRANT</strong>, was a British-born American actor. With his distinctive Mid-Atlantic accent, he was noted as perhaps the foremost exemplar of the debonair leading man, handsome, virile, charismatic and charming. He was named the second Greatest Male Star of All Time of American cinema, after Humphrey Bogart, by the American Film Institute. </p>   <p>Grant starred in some of the classic screwball comedies, including <em>Bringing Up Baby</em> with Katharine Hepburn, <em>His Girl Friday</em> with Rosalind Russell, <em>Arsenic and Old Lace</em> with Priscilla Lane, and <em>Monkey Business</em> with Ginger Rogers. His role in <em>The Awful Truth</em> with Irene Dunne was the pivotal film in the establishment of Grant's screen persona. These performances solidified his appeal, and <em>The Philadelphia Story</em>, with Hepburn and James Stewart, showcased his best-known screen persona: the charming if sometimes unreliable man, formerly married to an intelligent and strong-willed woman who first divorced him, then realized that he was-with all his faults-irresistible.</p>   <p>Grant was one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for several decades. He was a versatile actor, who did demanding physical comedy in movies like Gunga Din with the skills he had learned on the stage. Howard Hawks said that Grant was ""so far the best that there isn't anybody to be compared to him"".</p>   <p>Grant was a favorite actor of Alfred Hitchcock, notorious for disliking actors, who said that Grant was ""the only actor I ever loved in my whole life"". Grant appeared in such Hitchcock classics as <em>Suspicion</em>, <em>Notorious</em>, <em>To Catch a Thief</em> and <em>North by Northwest</em>. Biographer Patrick McGilligan wrote that, in 1965, Hitchcock asked Grant to star in <em>Torn Curtain</em> (1966), only to learn that Grant had decided to retire after making one more film, <em>Walk, Don't Run</em> (1966); Paul Newman was cast instead in <em>Torn Curtain</em>, opposite Julie Andrews.</p>   <p>In the mid-1950s, Grant formed his own production company, Grantley Productions, and produced a number of movies distributed by Universal, such as <em>Operation Petticoat</em>, <em>Indiscreet</em>, <em>That Touch of Mink</em> (co-starring Doris Day), and <em>Father Goose</em>. In 1963, he appeared opposite Audrey Hepburn in <em>Charade</em>.</p>   <p>Grant was considered a maverick by virtue of the fact that he was the first actor to ""go independent,"" effectively bucking the old studio system, which almost completely controlled what an actor could or could not do. In this way, Grant was able to control every aspect of his career. He decided which movies he was going to appear in, he had personal choice of the directors and his co-stars and at times, even negotiated a share of the gross, something unheard of at the time, but now common among A-list stars.</p>   <p>Grant was nominated for two Academy Awards in the 1940s. He was denied the Oscar throughout his active career because he was one of the first actors to be independent of the major studios. Grant received a special Academy Award for Lifetime Achievement in 1970. In 1981, he was accorded the Kennedy Center Honors.</p> <p>Â </p>   <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He records and tours with the E Street Band. Springsteen is widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments centered on his native New Jersey.Â   </p> <strong></strong> <p>Springsteen's recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock albums and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band perform intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, amongst which he intersperses whimsical or deeply emotional stories.</p>   <p>His most successful studio albums, <em>Born to Run</em> and <em>Born in the U.S.A.</em>, epitomize his penchant for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily life in America, and the latter album made him one of the most recognized artists of the 1980s within the United States. Because of his support for the presidential campaigns of Senator John Kerry and President Barack Obama, Springsteen has gradually become identified with liberal politics. He is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11 attacks, on which his album <em>The Rising</em> reflects.</p>   <p>He has earned numerous awards for his work, including twenty Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes and an Academy Award, and continues to have a strong global fan base. He has sold more than 65 million albums in the United States and 120 million worldwide.

In fine condition, with a few minor creases.</strong></p> <p><strong>RAY BOLGER</strong> (1904-1987) was an American entertainer of stage and screen, best known for his portrayal of the Scarecrow and Kansas farm worker in the 1939 film, <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>.</p>   <p>Bolger's film career began when he signed a contract with MGM in 1936. His best-known film appearance prior to The Wizard of Oz was <em>The Great Ziegfeld</em> (1936), in which he portrayed himself. But he also appeared in <em>Sweethearts</em>, (1938) the first MGM film in Technicolor, starring Nelson Eddy, Jeanette MacDonald, and Bolger's future Oz co-star, Frank Morgan, as well as the 1937 Eleanor Powell vehicle <em>Rosalie</em>, which also starred Eddy and Morgan.</p>   <p>Bolger's studio contract stipulated that he would play any part the studio chose; however, he was unhappy when he was cast as the Tin Man. The Scarecrow part had already been assigned to another lean and limber dancing studio contract player, Buddy Ebsen.</p>   <p>In time, the roles were switched. While Bolger was pleased with his role as the Scarecrow, Ebsen was struck ill by the powdered aluminum make-up used to complete the Tin Man costume. The powdered aluminum badly coated Ebsen's lungs, leaving him near death. Ironically, Ebsen would outlive all the principal players of Oz. Ebsen's illness paved the way for the Tin Man role to be filled by Jack Haley.</p>   <p>Bolger's performance in <em>Oz</em> was a tour de force, and he displayed the full range of his physical, comedic, and dramatic talents playing the character searching for the brain that he always had. The Scarecrow's sympathy for Dorothy Gale's plight, his cleverness and bravery in rescuing her from the Wicked Witch of the West (played by Margaret Hamilton) and his deep affection for her shone through, endearing the character - and Bolger - in the public mind forever. Whenever queried as to whether he received any residuals from telecasts of the 1939 classic, Bolger would reply: ""No, just immortality. I'll settle for that.""</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Burton was known to be drinking heavily during filming, and according to press reports at the time, director Terence Young actually had to have the great English actor sitting or laying down for many of his linesâbecause he couldn't stand and deliver them. He was also having a well publicized affair with a waitress at a local bar the film crew frequented. </p> <p>Original photographs of Burton and Taylor togetherâand Burton with his mistressâare included with this lot, as are press reports, a photograph of the master suite the couple stayed in, and the actual lease document signed on their behalf by the film company representatives.

He is generally regarded as one of the finest and most versatile actors in motion picture history. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Tracy among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time, ranking 9th on the list. He was nominated for nine Academy Awards for Best Actor in all.<br/><br/>In 1935 Tracy signed with Metro Goldwyn Mayer. He won the Academy Award for Best Actor two years in a row, for <em>Captains Courageous</em> (1937) and <em>Boys Town</em> (1938).<br/><br/>He was also nominated for <strong><em>San Francisco</em></strong> (1936), <em>Father of the Bride</em> (1950), <em>Bad Day at Black Rock</em> (1955), <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em> (1958), <em>Inherit the Wind</em> (1960), <em>Judgment at Nuremberg</em> (1961), and posthumously for <em>Guess Who's Coming to Dinner</em> (1967). Tracy and Laurence Olivier share the record in the number of their nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor.<br/><br/>Tracy's reputation for versatility and naturalness are based on the twenty years (1935-1967) he acted at Metro Goldwyn Mayer and for the subsequent dozen years when he was an independent actor. Yet the twenty-five films he made prior to his move to MGM are notable in that they demonstrate the range and diversity of characters he would continue to deliver through his career.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

At the time of its release the film inspired a whole subgenre of desert romance, in which hot, swarthy Arabs kidnap reckless white women. Valentino's playful treatment of the character captivated female audiences and established him as Hollywood's first male sex symbol. Newspapers reported that young women were running off to the Middle East in the hope of being abducted by handsome Arabs.</p>   <p>Accompanying this genuine autograph is a rare and highly desirable original photograph of Valentino, a still shot from <em>The Eagle</em>, in which he is handsomely dressed as the Cossack Lt. Vladimir Dubrovsky, the ""Black Eagle"". The photo bears a studio-stamped facsimile signature, ""Sincerely, Rudolph Valentino"". On the back is a pencil notation dated 1926, ""Received just [illegible] weeks before his death in August"". The photo is in warm black, ivory tones on thick vintage photographic paper. Minor creases and edge wearing, a few scattered marks and a very slight smear of dried glue, barely noticeable, is in the upper left corner, otherwise this photo is in fine condition, especially given that it's nearly 80 years old, and would frame up beautifully with the accompanying authentic autograph.</p> Â  <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Only a light crease through the ""D"" affects the signature. Accompanied by Letter of Authenticity by James Spence Authentication LLC.</p> <p><strong>JAMES BYRON DEAN</strong> (1931-1955) was a two-time Oscar-nominated American film actor. Dean's status as a cultural icon is best embodied in the title of his most celebrated film, <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em>, in which he starred as troubled stereotypical high school rebel Jim Stark. The other two roles that defined his star power were as the awkward loner Cal Trask in <em>East of Eden</em>, and as the surly farmer Jett Rink in <em>Giant</em>. His enduring fame and popularity rests on only three films, his entire starring output. His death at the young age of 24 helped guarantee a legendary status. He was the first actor to receive a posthumous Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and remains the only person to have two posthumous acting nominations.</p>   <p>In 1953, director Elia Kazan was looking for an actor to play the role of ""Cal Trask"" in screenwriter Paul Osborn's adaptation of John Steinbeck's 1952 novel <em>East of Eden</em>. The book dealt with the story of the Trask and Hamilton families over the course of three generations, focusing especially on the lives of the latter two generations in Salinas Valley, California in the mid-1800s through the 1910s. However, the film chose to deal predominantly with the character of Cal Trask, who is essentially the rebel son of a pious and constantly disapproving father (played by Raymond Massey), and estranged mother, whom Cal discovers is a brothel-keeping madam (Jo Van Fleet). Elia Kazan said of Cal before casting, ""I wanted a Brando for the role."" Osborn suggested to Kazan that he consider Dean for the part. After introducing Dean to Steinbeck, and gaining his enthusiastic approval, Kazan set about putting the wheels in motion to cast the relatively unknown young actor in the role. On March 8, 1954, Dean left New York City and headed for Los Angeles to begin shooting. Dean's performance in the film foreshadowed his role as Jim Stark in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>. Both characters are rebel loners and misunderstood outcasts, desperately craving parental guidance from a father figure.</p>   <p>Much of Dean's performance in the film is completely unscripted, such as his dance in the bean field and his curling up and pulling his arms inside of his shirt on top of the train during his ride home from meeting his mother. The most famous improvisation during the film was when Cal's father rejects his gift of $5,000 (which was in reparation for his father's business loss). Instead of running away from his father as the script called for, Dean instinctively turned to Massey and, crying, embraced him. This cut and Massey's shocked reaction were kept in the film by Kazan.</p>   <p>At the 1955 Academy Awards, he received a posthumous Best Actor in a Leading Role Academy Award nomination for this role, the first official posthumous acting nomination in Academy Awards history.</p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>Many American teens at the time of Dean's major movies identified with Dean and the roles he played, especially in <em>Rebel Without A Cause</em>: the typical teenager, caught where no one, not even his peers, can understand him.

According to author and Harvard professor Marjorie Garber, this quality is ""the undefinable extra something that makes a star."" Dean's iconic appeal has been attributed to the public's need for someone to stand up for the disenfranchised young of the era, and to the air of androgyny that he projected onscreen.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

WARNER</strong> (1892-1978), born Jacob Warner in London, Ontario, Canada, was the president and driving force behind the successful development of <strong>Warner Brothers Studios</strong> in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. Warner's 45-year career was lengthier than that of any other traditional Hollywood studio mogul.</p> <p>As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, Sam Warner, to procure the technology for the film industry's first talking picture. After Sam's death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, Harry and Albert Warner. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers' shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks.</p>   <p>Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and toughmindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.' top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known. Given to quick decision making, Warner once commented, ""If I'm right fifty-one percent of the time, I'm ahead of the game.""</p>   <p>Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure. Although he was a staunch Republican, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of Democratic President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. He speedily grasped the threat posed by European fascism and criticized Nazi Germany well before America's involvement in World War II. During the postwar era, however, Warner supported an anti-Communist crusade that culminated in the ""blacklisting"" of Hollywood directors, actors, screenwriters, and technicians. Despite his controversial public image, Warner remained a force in the motion picture industry until his retirement in the early 1970s.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He was known for brooding, sensitive, working-class character roles, and received four Academy Award nominations during his career. Appearing on Broadway at the age of thirteen, Clift achieved success on the stage and starred there for ten years before moving to Hollywood, debuting in 1948's <em>Red River</em> opposite John Wayne.<br/><br/>In 1958 he turned down what became Dean Martin's role in <em>Rio Bravo</em>, which would have reunited him with Wayne. This may have been because of the tension between the two actors: Wayne would refuse to socialize with Clift between takes during the filming of <em>Red River</em> because of Wayne's disapproval of Clift's sexuality.<br/><br/>Clift was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor that same year for <em>The Search</em>. His sensitive and intense quality gave him an image as the kind of a person to be taken care of. His love scenes with Elizabeth Taylor in <em>A Place in the Sun</em> (1951) represented a new standard for romance in cinema. His roles in <em>A Place in the Sun</em>, the 1953 classic <em>From Here to Eternity</em> and <em>The Young Lions</em> (1958) were career milestones.<br/><br/>Clift and Marlon Brando, who was also born in Omaha, had reputations as Hollywood rivals because of their rapid rise to stardom and similar acting styles. Clift was one of James Dean's idols and he would sometimes call him ""just to hear his voice.""</p> <p>Clift reportedly turned down the starring roles in <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> and <em>East of Eden</em>. At one point he was receiving so many offers of roles that scripts literally filled up his home. Friends had to squeeze past stacks of them in order to walk up the stairs.<br/><br/>On May 12, 1956, while filming <em>Raintree County</em>, he smashed his car into a telephone pole after leaving a party at the home of his <em>Raintree County</em> co-star Elizabeth Taylor and her then-husband Michael Wilding. Alerted by friend Kevin McCarthy, who witnessed the accident, Taylor raced to Clift's side and kept him from choking to death by removing two of his teeth, which had become lodged in his throat. Clift suffered spinal damage. Most of the injuries on his face were apparently below the skin; doctors elected not to do plastic surgery. In a filmed interview, he later described how his nose could be snapped back into place. After a long recovery, he returned to the set to finish the film. Against the movie studio's worries over profits, Clift rightly predicted the film would do well, if only because moviegoers would flock to see the difference in his facial appearance before and after the accident. The pain of the accident led him to rely on alcohol and pills for relief, as he had done after an earlier bout with dysentery (thanks to a film shot in Mexico) left him with chronic intestinal problems. As a result, Clift's health and looks deteriorated considerably. Taylor and Clift remained close friends until his death.<br/><br/>On Monday, July 22, 1966, Clift spent most of the day in his bedroom in his New York City townhouse. He and his live-in personal secretary, Lorenzo James, had not spoken much all day. At 1 a.m., Lorenzo went up to say goodnight. <em>The Misfits</em> was airing on TV that night, and Lorenzo asked Clift if he wanted to watch it. ""Absolutely NOT!"" was the reply. Those were his last words to anyone. At 6 a.m. the next morning, Lorenzo went to wake him, but found the bedroom door locked. Unable to break it down, he ran down to the garden and climbed a ladder to the bedroom window. When he got inside, he found Clift dead. He was undressed, lying on his back in bed, with glasses on and fists clenched. He was 45 years old.<br/><br/>Â <br/><br/>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 John Wayne, John,Wayne,Entertainment,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/john-wayne-autograph-signature-signed/,Signature on Autograph Album Page,"  <p><strong>Large, clear and bold pencil signature on 4.25"" x 5.5"" autograph album page,</strong> from the collection of another actor of the same period. Perfect for framing.<strong><br/><br/>JOHN WAYNE </strong>(1907-1979), born Marion Robert Morrison, was an Academy Award-winning American film actor, director and producer. He epitomized rugged masculinity and has become an enduring American icon. He is famous for his distinctive voice, walk and height. He was also known for his conservative political views and his support in the 1950s for anti-communist positions.<br/><br/>A Harris Poll released January 2009 placed Wayne third among America's favorite film stars, the only deceased star on the list and the only one who has appeared on the poll every year since it first began in 1994. In 1999, the American Film Institute named Wayne 13th among the Greatest Male Stars of All Time, having appeared in over 170 films.<br/><br/>As a teen, Wayne worked in an ice cream shop for a man who shod horses for Hollywood studios. He played football for the 1924 champion Glendale High School team. Wayne applied to the U.S. Naval Academy, but was not accepted. He instead attended the University of Southern California (USC), majoring in pre-law. He was a member of the Trojan Knights and Sigma Chi fraternities. Wayne also played on the USC football team, but an injury curtailed his athletic career; Wayne later noted he was too terrified of his coach's reaction to reveal the actual cause of his injury, which was bodysurfing at the ""Wedge"" at the tip of the Balboa Peninsula in Newport Beach. He lost his athletic scholarship and, without funds, had to leave the university.<br/><br/>Wayne began working at the local film studios. Prolific silent western film star <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/tom-mix-signed-photo-autographed-tony-wonder-horse-straight-shooter-club-badge"">Tom Mix</a> had gotten him a summer job in the prop department in exchange for football tickets. Wayne soon moved on to bit parts, establishing a longtime friendship with the director who provided most of those roles, John Ford. Early in this period, Wayne appeared with his USC teammates playing football in <em>Brown of Harvard</em> (1926), <em>The Dropkick</em> (1927), and <em>Salute</em> (1929) and Columbia's <em>Maker of Men</em> (filmed in 1930, released in 1931).<br/><br/><em>The Searchers</em> (1956) continues to be widely regarded as perhaps Wayne's finest and most complex performance. In 2006 Premiere Magazine ran an industry poll in which Wayne's portrayal of Ethan Edwards was rated the 87th greatest performance in film history. He named his youngest son Ethan after the character. John Wayne won a Best Actor Oscar for <em>True Grit</em> (1969). Wayne was also nominated as the producer of Best Picture for <em>The Alamo</em> (1960), one of two films he directed. The other was <em>The Green Berets</em> (1968), the only major film made during the Vietnam War to support the war. During the filming of <em>Green Berets</em>, the Degar or Montagnard people of Vietnam's Central Highlands, fierce fighters against communism, bestowed on Wayne a brass bracelet that he wore in the film and all subsequent films. His last film was <em>The Shootist</em> (1976), whose main character, J. B. Books, was dying of cancerâthe illness to which Wayne himself succumbed 3 years later.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He developed a pipe designed for motorists in 1904, and  a tobacconist's shop in St James's in 1907, offering tailored tobacco blends. Shops were later opened in New York and Paris in the 1920s. With his international ambitions, Dunhill helped to create the modern luxury goods market. </p> <p>Before the Cuban Revolution, Dunhill had numerous distribution and marketing agreements with several Cuban cigar manufacturers, selling exclusive and hard to find brands such as Don CÃ¡ndido and Dunhill's own SelecciÃ³n Suprema line, with various sizes from many famous cigar makers such as Montecristo and Romeo y Julieta.

Welles received a 1975 American Film Institute Lifetime Achievement award, the third person to do so after John Ford and James Cagney. Critical appreciation for Welles has increased since his death. He is now widely acknowledged as one of the most important dramatic artists of the 20th century: in 2002 he was voted as the greatest film director of all time in the British Film Institute's poll of Top Ten Directors.</p>   <p>Â </p>   <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

One of the most controversial stars of her day, West encountered many problems including censorship.</p>   <p>When her cinematic career ended, she continued to perform on stage, in Las Vegas, in the United Kingdom, on radio and television, and recorded Rock and Roll albums.</p> <p>Not only was <em>Diamond Lil</em> a big hit on Broadway, but more significantly it launched Mae West's career toward Hollywood stardom. She debuted on film in 1932 with what was supposed to be a small part in <em>Night After Night</em>, starring George Raft. However, she insisted on rewriting all her lines, and the result was pure box office gold-for West and for the film. Building on this success she was able to translate her Broadway play <em>Diamond Lil</em> to the big screen as <em>She Done Him Wrong</em> in 1933. Audiences went wild, and the film was a huge success, garnering an Academy Award nomination and catapulting male lead Cary Grant, to stardom. What's more the picture saved its studio, Paramount Pictures, from bankruptcy.</p> <p>Mae West lives on in cultural history as well. During World War II, Allied soldiers called their yellow inflatable, vest-like life preserver jackets ""Mae Wests"" partly from Cockney rhyming slang for ""life vest"" and partly because of the resemblance to her curvaceous torso. A ""Mae West"" is also a type of round parachute malfunction which contorts the shape of the canopy into the appearance of an extraordinarily large brassiere, presumably one suitable for a woman of Mae West's generous proportions.</p>   <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

One of the most controversial stars of her day, West encountered many problems including censorship.</p>   <p>When her cinematic career ended, she continued to perform on stage, in Las Vegas, in the United Kingdom, on radio and television, and recorded Rock and Roll albums.</p>   <p>During World War II, Allied soldiers called their yellow inflatable, vest-like life preserver jackets ""Mae Wests"" partly from Cockney rhyming slang for ""life vest"" and partly because of the resemblance to her curvaceous torso. A ""Mae West"" is also a type of round parachute malfunction which contorts the shape of the canopy into the appearance of an extraordinarily large brassiere, presumably one suitable for a woman of Mae West's generous proportions.</p>   <p>Her name has been incorporated into nomenclature for a number of items. A Mae West slot canyon is one that is too narrow at the bottom to traverse on foot. Instead, one uses chimneying techniques to negotiate above the floor. A ""Mae West Hold"" is a term used to describe a United States Senate procedure that in effect stops a bill dead in its tracks, usually in secret. The Mae West version of the Senate hold occurs when the senator behind the objection is open to negotiation, inviting the author to ""come up and see me sometime."" MAE-West was also the name of the Metropolitan Area Exchange West, one of the first Internet tier-one hubs to connect all the major TCP/IP networks that made up the Internet back in 1992. It is not documented whether the founders of MAE-West named this early Internet Exchange after the actress. One of the most popular objects of the surrealist movement was the Mae West Lips Sofa, which was completed by artist Salvador DalÃ­ in 1937 for Edward James.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

A talented linguist, and an astute mimic, he had an ear for languages which became apparent later in his acting career. He qualified for the United States fencing team prior to the 1936 Summer Olympic Games, but quit the team just prior to the games saying that it was in order to take a role in the theater.    </p> <strong></strong> <p>Hired as a fencing teacher by Laurence Olivier for his 1940 Broadway production of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>, Wilde was given the role of Tybalt in the production. Because of this role, he was noticed by Hollywood.</p>   <p>Wilde entered City College of New York (CCNY) as a member of the Class of 1933 but dropped out after his freshman year. He had several small film roles until he played the role of FrÃ©dÃ©ric Chopin in 1945's <em>A Song to Remember</em>, for which he was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1945 he also starred in <em>A Thousand and One Nights</em> with Evelyn Keyes. He spent the rest of the decade appearing in romantic and swashbuckling films, but he also appeared in some significant films noir, opposite Gene Tierney in <em>Leave Her to Heaven</em> (1945), <em>Road House</em> (1948) and <em>Shockproof</em> (1949), the latter film also starring his then wife Patricia Knight.</p>   <p>In the 1950s, Wilde created his own film production company and produced the film noir <em>The Big Combo</em> (1955). Wilde played the male lead alongside his second wife Jean Wallace. That same year, he appeared in an episode of <em>I Love Lucy</em> as himself. In 1957, he played the role of the 13th century Persian poet Omar Khayyam in the film <em>Omar Khayyam</em>.</p>   <p>He produced, directed, and starred in <em>The Naked Prey</em> (1966), in which he played a naked man being tracked by hunters from an African tribe affronted by the behavior of members of a safari party. The original script for <em>The Naked Prey</em> was largely based on a true historical incident about a trapper named John Colter being pursued by Blackfeet Indians in Wyoming. Lower shooting costs, tax breaks, and material and logistical assistance offered by Rhodesia convinced Wilde and the other producers to shoot the film there.</p>   <p>Wilde's other notable directing efforts include <em>Beach Red</em> (1967) and <em>No Blade of Grass</em> (1970).</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Inspired by the Folies BergÃ¨res of Paris, <strong>Florenz Ziegfeld</strong> produced the enormously successful <strong>Ziegfeld Follies</strong>, which were lavish revues, something between later Broadway shows and a more elaborate high class Vaudeville variety show. Many of the top entertainers of the era (including Eddie Cantor, Fanny Brice, Ann Pennington, Bert Williams, <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/category/All-Categories/name/Will-Rogers/view/items"" target=""_blank"">Will Rogers</a>, Ruth Etting, Helen Morgan, Marilyn Miller, W.C. Fields, Ed Wynn, Gilda Gray, Nora Bayes, The Tiller Girls, and others) appeared in the shows. The Ziegfeld Follies were also famous for many beautiful chorus girls commonly known as Ziegfeld girls, usually decked in elaborate costumes by designers such as ErtÃ©, Lady Duff Gordon or Ali Ben Hagan, which became the talk of Broadway the following day. The Follies ran at the New Amsterdan Theatre first from 1913-1920 and again from 1922-1927.</p>   <p><strong>George M. Cohan</strong> and <strong>Sam Harris</strong> were hugely successful Broadway producers, partners (and close friends) since 1904 when The Four Cohans (George's vaudevillian family act) broke up, until 1920. ""<strong>Hitch</strong>"" is <strong>Raymond Hitchcock</strong>, a comic actor and producer who had appeared in the <em>Ziegfeld Follies</em> as well as many Cohan/Harris plays. </p>   <p><strong>Charles Dillingham</strong> was a Broadway producer who started his career as a theater reviewer for the <em>New York Evening Post</em>, then became a manager for such actors as Julia Marlowe. He also produced several musicals and musical reviews during his career, including <em>General Post</em>, a satirical play in 1917. (General Post was also the name of an old children's game, sometimes called Stage Coach, in which at the drop of a handkerchief there is a general scurry that leaves every one quite differently placed). Dillingham and Ziegfeld were partners in the management of the Century Theatre, and in production of the play <em>The Century Girl</em> in 1916. </p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Thirteen years after her death, she was portrayed on the Broadway stage by Barbra Streisand in the musical <em>Funny Girl</em>. The musical was made into a film in 1968. </p> <p>To Florenz Ziegfeld, entrepreneur of the sensual and creator of <em>The Ziegfeld Follies</em>, a comedian was someone who kept audiences distracted while his beloved chorus girls were changing costumes. Still, he would have only the bestâWill Rogers, WC Fields, Bert Williamsâand when he heard Fanny sing ""Sadie Salome, Go Home"" with a Yiddish accent in a Broadway burlesque, he knew that with her onstage his girls could take their time.</p>   <p>Fanny Brice was almost 19. She had been born on the Lower East Side and brought up above a saloon in Newark. She was tall and skinnyâa drawback in 1910, when chorus girls were at the very least statuesque. Skinny was funny. A comedian could capitalize on skinny.</p>   <p>The dream of every dancer, singer and comic in America was to make the <em>Follies</em>, so on the day Fanny arrived at work and was handed a telegram signed ""Florenz Ziegfeld"", she thought it was a joke. Still, what if... She didn't know that correspondence by telegram was Ziegfeld's style. On a hunch she telephoned. A moment later, she was whooping down Broadway.</p>   <p>After she signed the <em>Follies</em> contract, Fanny recovered enough to thank Ziegfeld in her most ladylike manner. She thanked the secretary. She thanked the doorman. Then she raced back down Broadway and stood outside the burlesque house all afternoon, grabbing people, showing them.</p>   <p>Many more contracts followed. For 20 years, Fanny sang her funny/sad songs and lampooned ballet dancers in graceful poses and society ladies from Sutton Place and Oyster Bay. And Ziegfeld smiled his tender smile and wrote out his generous checks, because the <em>Follies</em> wasn't the <em>Follies</em> without Fanny.</p>   <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

These refugees, particularly the more recent ones, are able to provide valuable information as to what is going on behind the Iron Curtain, of which our limited knowledge is a distinct military handicap.

This aerial cartograph of Vatican City shows the principal buildings and layout, including Piazza di San Pietro, Piazza Rusticucci, Piazza della Sagrestia, Cortile di Belvedere, Giardino della Pigna, and many others.

In 1839, Baedeker gave a contract to Wagner for a regular supply of maps for his increasingly popular guidebooks. Propelled by Baedeker's growth, the firm expanded steadily for the next several decades. In 1872, when Baedeker moved from Koblenz to Leipzig, Wagner also relocated. At the time of the move, Eduard's son Heinrich took over the business from his father. In Leipzig, he joined forces with Ernst Debes, a noted cartographer from the firm of Justus Perthes in Gotha, to form H. Wagner &amp; E. Debes. In addition to its work for Baedeker, the firm published atlases and wall maps, especially for use in schools. This 1900 map of Vatican City is typical of the high-quality maps produced by the company, which flourished until the eve of World War II.</p> <p>Â </p>  ",1900,350,0,FALSE,3388,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8C5CADC5-1517-6111-28E5852A2F4CD268.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8C5D5985-1517-6111-2813147643E84B04.jpg",

Succeeding his assassinated father to the throne in 336, Alexander inherited a strong kingdom and a highly accomplished army. Following in the path of his father's military expansion plans, in 334 Alexander invaded the Achaemenid Empire, ruled Asia Minor, and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. In a series of decisive battles he subsequently conquered the entire Persian Empire, at which point his own empire now stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River, as depicted on the far right edge of this historical map. </p> <p>Though his military conquests were significant in themselves, Alexander's legacy extended well beyond battle. His campaigns resulted in substantial trade between East and West, and vast areas east of Macedonia were heavily exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Many of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, some surviving into the 21st century. </p> <p><strong>Emanuel Bowen</strong> (1694?-1767) was an English map engraver who worked for King George II of England and King Louis XV of France. Working from his London studio at around age 20, Bowen produced some of the most attractive maps of the century, recognized for their high quality and accuracy. A recurring feature of Bowen's work was his habit of filling every corner and space of the map with jottings and footnotes, both historical and topographical, as can be seen in this map of Alexander's conquests.</p> <p>One of his earliest engraved works was Britannia Depicta, published in 1720 and featuring over two hundred road maps together with a miniature county map of England and Wales. It was an unusual feature of the atlas that the maps were engraved on both sides of each page, and this resulted in a handier sized book. </p>  ",1732,sold,1,FALSE,3636,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/6AD0ADA8-1517-6111-2834682A405F817D.png,"Alexander the Great,  Emanuel Bowen"

Each owed his allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan, who demanded that payment of an annual tribute be made to his treasury in exchange for the protection afforded by his Army. It was a tidy arrangement, one that worked well for the Sultan and those who knew their place in the social order. That the local rulers were obliged to share a portion of their meager income with Constantinople meant that new, more assured opportunities for profit would have to be found. The solution was piracy.</p> <p>For nearly four centuries the Barbary States, and the brigands they employed, prowled the Mediterranean in search of prey. The lumbering merchant vessels of the time were no match for the Muslim corsairs, built for speed and lightning strikes. It was a way of life that took its toll on countless merchant ships, most of which were only lightly armed and had little capacity to resist capture.</p> <p>The crews who fell victim to this banditry were destined, often times, for a miserable fate. After seizing their cargo and scuttling the vessels, the pirates would then ransom the ill-fated seamen back to their sovereign or the company that had chartered them. Usually, though, the victims of these maritime hijackings would languish in fetid prisons, unsure of when, or even if, they would ever be rescued. Most were sold into slavery.</p> <p>It was a lucrative business, one that yielded great riches not only for the pirates, but also for the Muslim states that gave them refuge. For many of the rulers, plunder became a mainstay of their survival. In the parlance of our time this was state-sponsored terrorism pure and simpleâan extortion racket in which the pirate, the petty states of North Africa and the Ottoman Empire were all complicit.</p> <h3>America's First Hostage Crisis</h3> <p>The episode began in 1785, when an American schooner <em>Maria</em>, sailing off the coast of Portugal, was boarded by Algerian pirates. Its captain and five crewmembers were taken prisoners. Then a second American ship, the brig <em>Dauphin</em> was captured, and its 15-member crew was taken to Algiers and enslaved. Several hostages were put to work as domestic servants; another was forced to care for the Dey (King) of Algiers's lion. Much of the time the hostages were kept in leg irons, chained to pillars or locked in a rat-infested prison. Six Americans died of bubonic plague; one went insane.</p> <p>In a bid to free the American hostages, Thomas Jefferson, then Minister to France, offered to pay $200 ransom for each American prisoner. This sum was well below the going rate of $1,600 per hostage. As a result, the hapless prisoners languished in captivity. Over the next eight years, Algerian pirates seized more than a hundred hostages from a dozen captured American ships.</p> <p>Finally, in 1795, the State Department dispatched a prominent American, Joel Barlow, to negotiate for the hostages' release. To gain the captives' freedom, the United States agreed to pay $800,000 plus annual tributeâwhich at the time totaled one-sixth of the entire U.S. budgetâand to provide the Dey of Algiers with a brand-new 36-gun frigate. In 1797, the hostages were freed and sailed to Philadelphia, where they were greeted by cheering crowds.</p> <p>Although the hostages were now free, the story was not yet over. After the military ruler of Tripoli learned that the Dey of Algiers had received an American frigate, he demanded a ship of his own. When the United States refused to accede to his demand, the Pasha of Tripoli seized an American merchant ship and ordered the flag of the U.S. consulate in Tripoli cut down.</p> <p>Launched in 1797, the <em>U.S.S. Constitution</em> (""Old Ironsides"") and her sister ship, the <em>U.S.S. Constellation</em>, were built to wage war on the Muslim pirates operating along North Africa's Barbary coast. The continuing demand for tribute ultimately led to the formation of the United States Department of the Navy, founded in 1798 in order to prevent further piracy attacks upon American shipping as well as to end the extremely large demand for tribute from the Barbary States.<br/> </p>  ",1797,sold,1,FALSE,3319,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/00045BBC-3048-C0CE-5583D3F999468E07.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/0004BE3B-3048-C0CE-55EDAA5365AA7999.jpg",

Succeeding his assassinated father to the throne in 336, Alexander inherited a strong kingdom and a highly accomplished army. Following in the path of his father's military expansion plans, in 334 Alexander invaded the Achaemenid Empire, ruled Asia Minor, and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. In a series of decisive battles he subsequently conquered the entire Persian Empire, at which point his own empire now stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River, as depicted on the far right edge of this historical map. </p> <p>Though his military conquests were significant in themselves, Alexander's legacy extended well beyond battle. His campaigns resulted in substantial trade between East and West, and vast areas east of Macedonia were heavily exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Many of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, some surviving into the 21st century. </p> <p><strong>Emanuel Bowen</strong> (1694?-1767) was an English map engraver who worked for King George II of England and King Louis XV of France. Working from his London studio at around age 20, Bowen produced some of the most attractive maps of the century, recognized for their high quality and accuracy. A recurring feature of Bowen's work was his habit of filling every corner and space of the map with jottings and footnotes, both historical and topographical, as can be seen in this map of Alexander's conquests.</p> <p>One of his earliest engraved works was Britannia Depicta, published in 1720 and featuring over two hundred road maps together with a miniature county map of England and Wales.

Coffee is thought to have been first brewed by the Arabs, but its popularity may not have spread as quickly as it did were it not for Clement. Once coffee was discovered being consumed in Rome, Vatican priests believed that Satan had invented the drink as a substitute for wine, which Muslims were not permitted to drink. Since wine was used in such Christian practices as Holy Communion, priests determined that coffee was an evil tool of the Anti-Christ. In the face of such strong beliefs, Pope Clement VIII asked to try a cup before making a decision. When he did, he blessed the drink as a Christian beverage, resulting in massive imports of coffee to Italy and the Western world. </p>  ",1601,sold,1,FALSE,3723,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/148DA993-1517-6111-2801661A20ACCEBE.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/148E28B6-1517-6111-2884225F0CF872C8.jpg",

Conder</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Claude Reignier Conder</strong> (1848-1910) was a British soldier, engineer, biblical archaeologist and member of the Royal Geographical Society. Educated at University College London and the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, Conder became a lieutenant in the Corps of Royal Engineers at age 22 and went on to enjoy a distinguished career, potentially marred only by one recent suspicionâthat he was England's infamous serial killer <strong>Jack the Ripper</strong>.</p> <p>Commissioned by Britain's Palestine Exploration Fund (PEF), in 1872 Conder began extensive survey work in Palestine, and in 1874 was joined by fellow Royal Engineer <strong>Horatio Herbert Kitchener</strong> to carry out a mapping survey of the Holy Land. Between 1874 and 1877 Conder and Kitchener surveyed what is today Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. The results of their expedition were published in 1883 by the PEF, among eight volumes known as the Survey of Western Palestine, still in use today as the basis for the grid system used in modern maps of Israel and Palestine.</p> <p>In another volume of the Survey of Western Palestine, Conder and fellow school chum <strong>Sir Charles Warren</strong> gained worldwide fame by writing of their excavations of hundreds of sites in the Middle East between 1867 and 1882. Significantly, they also discovered the remains of King Solomon's Temple in Jerusalem, from which Conder recovered a number of artifacts and rings he brought back home to London.</p> <p>Conder's correspondent in this letter, <strong>William Hepworth Dixon</strong>, was also a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.

Edward VIII is readily available as Duke of Windsor, but having reigned for less than a full year, <strong><em>his autograph as King is scarce</em></strong> (and unknown to us on a Letter of State); according to <em>American Book Prices Current</em>, only one other known letter sold at auction, in 1999. </p>   <p><strong>Edward VIII, King of the United Kingdom and the Dominions of the British Commonwealth and Emperor of India </strong>(1894-1972, ruled during 1936); abdicated within a year of becoming King, to marry American divorcee, Mrs. Wallis Simpson, and was created Duke of Windsor. </p> <p>When George V died on January 20, 1936, Prince Edward became King Edward VIII. Because the monarch is the head of the Church of England and is also expected to set an example of the British way of life, King Edward's family disapproved of his continued liaison with Mrs. Simpson. Their vacation together aboard a yacht in the summer of 1936 was sensationally reported in the foreign press and caused considerable anxiety in British royal and governmental circles. The crisis began in October 1936, when Wallis Simpson was granted a decree <em>nisi</em>-a divorce that would become final in six months-from Ernest Simpson, a British shipping executive. A few weeks later the king told the prime minister, the staid Conservative Stanley Baldwin, that he wanted to marry Wallis Simpson and that if he could not do so and remain king, he was ""prepared to go.""</p>   <p>His brief reign was just 326 days. In a radio speech after renouncing the throne, Edward remarked ""I have found it impossible to carry on the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge the duties of king as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love."" </p>   <p>Following his abdication Simpson and Edward were married in France on 3 June 1937. It was Edward's first marriage, and they had no children. </p>   <p>Upon his abdication his brother Albert ascended the throne as King George VI, and Edward became Duke of Windsor. He served as Governor of the Bahamas from 1940 to 1945, and spent the rest of his life living abroad, mainly in France. After their deaths he and Wallis Simpson were buried on the grounds of Windsor Castle.</p> <p>Â </p> <p><meta content=""text/html; charset=utf-8"" http-equiv=""Content-Type""/><meta content=""Word.Document"" name=""ProgId""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Generator""/><meta content=""Microsoft Word 12"" name=""Originator""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_filelist.xml"" rel=""File-List""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_themedata.thmx"" rel=""themeData""/><link href=""file:///C:%5CUsers%5CGary%5CAppData%5CLocal%5CTemp%5Cmsohtmlclip1%5C01%5Cclip_colorschememapping.xml"" rel=""colorSchemeMapping""/><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>     Normal   0               false   false   false      EN-US   X-NONE   X-NONE                                                     MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                                                   </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </xml><![endif]--><style> </style><!--[if gte mso 10]> <style>  /* Style Definitions */  table.MsoNormalTable 	{mso-style-name:""Table Normal""; 	mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; 	mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; 	mso-style-noshow:yes; 	mso-style-priority:99; 	mso-style-qformat:yes; 	mso-style-parent:""""; 	mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; 	mso-para-margin-top:0in; 	mso-para-margin-right:0in; 	mso-para-margin-bottom:10.0pt; 	mso-para-margin-left:0in; 	line-height:115%; 	mso-pagination:widow-orphan; 	font-size:11.0pt; 	font-family:""Calibri"",""sans-serif""; 	mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; 	mso-fareast-font-family:""Times New Roman""; 	mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; 	mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; 	mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} </style> <![endif]--> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Isabel also belonged to the royal House of TrastÃ¡mara. Married under the joint motto, <em>tanto monta, monta tanto</em>, the two young monarchs were initially obliged to fight a civil war against Joan, princess of Castile (also known as Juana la Beltraneja), the purported daughter of Henry IV, and were swiftly successful. When Ferdinand succeeded his father as King of Aragon in 1479, the Crown of Castile and the various territories of the Crown of Aragon were united in a personal union creating for the first time since the 8th century a single political unit referred to as EspaÃ±a (Spain), the root of which is the ancient name Hispania, although the various states were not formerly administered as a single unit until the 18th century, but rather, as separate political units under the same Crown.<br/><br/>The first decade of Ferdinand and Isabella's joint rule were taken up with the conquest of the Kingdom of Granada, the last Arab-Muslim state in the Iberian peninsula, which was completed by 1492. In that same year, the Alhambra Decree was issued, expelling all Jews from both Castile and Aragon, and <strong>Christopher Columbus</strong> was sent by the couple on his expedition (ostensibly bound for east Asia) which resulted in the European arrival in the America.</p> <p>Â </p> <div style=""text-align: center""><img alt=""Ferdinand II"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_310633C9-3048-C0CE-5543FE89C0423C43.jpg"" title=""Ferdinand II"" width=""251""/></div>   <p>Â </p> <p>Â </p>  ",c1500,sold,1,FALSE,3114,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/310525BE-3048-C0CE-5579A4C996A23D41.jpg,

I think you have correctly represented my position. I am glad it has appealed to you.</strong></p><p><strong>Yours sincerely,<br/>M. K. Gandhi</strong></p><p><strong>Sabarmati<br/>2 : 2 : '30</strong></p></blockquote> <p>Dated February 2, 1930, this letter was written just a week following Gandhi's publication of India's Declaration of Independence, and one month to the day before he warned the British that he and others in his ashram would begin breaking the Salt Laws. This was a momentous period in Gandhi's life, mere days before a major civil disobedience campaign against the British in India.</p> <p>In protest of the 1882 Salt Act, which forbade Indians from making their own salt (enforcing a British trade monopoly), Gandhi led a 200-mile march from his ashram in Ahmedabad to the coastal town of Dandi. Arriving at the Arabian Sea with 78 followers, Gandhi knelt down and, as a gesture of defiance, picked up a piece of natural, unprocessed salt from the shore, thereby violating British law. His march received widespread support across India, inspiring thousands of Indians to follow his example of non-violent civil disobedience. British authorities arrested more than one hundred thousand protesters, including Gandhi himself, but were forced to release Gandhi and other Indian leaders to negotiate an end to the protests.</p> <p>With letter of provenance and history of correspondence from Professor Armstrong's family, including a receipt for Armstrong's room accommodations at a hotel believed to have been near the ashram in 1929.</p> <p align=""center"">Â <img alt=""Mohandas Gandhi"" height=""342"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_F0BF8007-1517-6111-28C928DAB929CBE0.jpg"" title=""Mohandas Gandhi"" width=""290""/></p>  ",1930,sold,1,FALSE,3602,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F0C084D2-1517-6111-28D1AAF4BF86AFCF.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F0C2F927-1517-6111-287EF76A5B3CC566.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/F0C3F085-1517-6111-286527CBC2166E25.png",

The Duke was an army officer and served as commander-in-chief of the British Army from 1856 to 1895. He became Duke of Cambridge in 1850.<br/><br/>Prince George was born at Cambridge House in Hanover, Germany. His father was Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, the 10th child and 7th son of King George III and Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. His mother was The Duchess of Cambridge (nÃ©e Princess Augusta of Hesse-Cassel), the daughter of Prince Frederick of Hesse, lord of Rumpenheim and Caroline Polyxena of Nassau-Usingen.<br/><br/>Prince George was an army officer and served as Commander-In-Chief of the British Army from 1856 to 1895. Upon the outbreak of the Crimean War, he received command of the 1st Division (Guards and Highland brigades) of the British army in the East. In June 1854, he was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-General. He was present at the battles of the Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman, and at the siege of Sevastopol. <br/><br/>On 5 July 1856 the Duke was appointed General Commanding-In-Chief of the British Army; a post that was retitled Commander-In-Chief of the forces in 1887. In that capacity he served as the chief military advisor to the Secretary of State for War, with responsibility for the administration of the army and the command of forces in the field. However, the commander-in-chief was not subordinate to the secretary of state. He was promoted of the rank of field marshal on 9 November 1862. Â <br/><br/>The Duke of Cambridge was the longest serving head of the British Army, serving as commander-in-chief for 39 years. Although he was deeply concerned about the welfare of soldiers, he earned a reputation for being resistant to doctrinal change and for making promotions based upon an officer's social standing, rather than his merit.</p> <p>Â <img alt=""Prince George, Duke of Cambridge"" height=""299"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomsm_EE0D7B18-3048-C0CE-5506AEF76D239D16.png"" title=""Prince George, Duke of Cambridge"" width=""131""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Pope Innocent III, Pope,Innocent III,World History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/pope-innocent-iii-lead-papal-bulla-seal/,Lead Papal Bulla,"  <p>Extremely scarce lead papal bulla from the reign of Pope Innocent III, the most significant pope of the Middle Ages. With a 4cm diameter and 5mm thickness, this seal is in fine, even spectacular condition given its age.Â In custom presentation case.</p> <p>A papal bull is a specific kind of public decree or charter issued by a pope of the Roman Catholic Church. It is named after the leaden seal (bulla) that was traditionally appended to the end in order to authenticate it. On the obverse it depicted, originally somewhat crudely, the early Fathers of the Church of Rome, the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, identified by the letters Sanctus PAulus and Sanctus PEtrus (thus, SPA â¢SPE or SPASPE). St. Paul, on the left, was shown with flowing hair and a long pointed beard composed of curved lines, while St. Peter, on the right, was shown with curly hair and a shorter beard made of dome-shaped globetti (beads in relief). Each head was surrounded by a circle of globetti, and the rim of the seal was surrounded by an additional ring of such beads, while the heads themselves were separated by a depiction of a cross. On the reverse was the name of the issuing pope in the nominative Latin form, with the letters ""PP"", for Pastor Pastorum (""Shepherd of Shepherds""). This disc was then attached to the document either by cords of hemp, in the case of letters of justice and executory letters, or by red and yellow silk, in the case of letters of grace, that was looped through slits in the vellum of the document. The term ""bulla"" derives from the Latin ""bullire"" (""""to boil""""), and alludes to the fact that, whether of wax, lead, or gold, the material making the seal had to be melted to soften it for impression.Â </p> <p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"">Pope Innocent III (1161-1216) reigned from January 1198 to his death in 1216. He was one of the most powerful and influential popes, exerting a wide influence over the Christian states of Europe by claiming supremacy over all of Europe's kings.</span></p> <p>During his reign Pope Innocent called for Christian crusades against Muslim Spain and the Holy Land, as well as the Albigensian Crusade against the Cathars in southern France. In his efforts to suppress the heresy spreading throughout the region, the pope consigned his troops to their commanders, invoking a special benediction to all lauding the divinity of their mission. Asked how they might distinguish their Christian brethren from the heretics, however, Pope Innocent's directive was unequivocal: ""Kill them all.

Their reaction to this was to flee to France to seek Cardinal Mazarin's protection. Mazarin forced the new pontiff to pardon them or face a military threat in the Papal States. Innocent acquiesced and pardoned them. But Innocent himself was not immune to nepotism and soon bestowed wealth and titles and offices on members of his own family. </p> <p>His papacy was characterized primarily by political matters, but ecclesiastical issues were also important. He was known for giving strong support to foreign missions, for founding a college at Ravenna, and for raising the status of a college to a university in the Philippines. But the greatest issue he faced in matters of faith concerned the condemnation of Jansenism, which was the extremist views of St. Augustine's teaching on grace and free will. Innocent even took part in several sessions of a commission he established to examine their work. In the end it was unconditionally condemned and before his death, the French government agreed with him, serving to contain the spread of this heretical movement. </p> <p>Innocent died a rather slow and agonizing death that allowed his relatives to loot and transport the papacy's wealth elsewhere.

Joseph August's grandfather had been Palatine Joseph of Hungary (1776-1847), Palatine and Viceroy of Hungary, a younger son of Emperor Leopold II. </p>   <p>August was highly decorated before World War I broke out. Some of his awards include The Bronze Military Merit Medal, Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Joseph, The Marianer Cross of the Deutscher Ritterorden, The Order of the Black Eagle, The 1st Class of the Order of the Red Eagle, The Grand Cross of the Victorian Order of Great Britain, the Grand Cross of the Order of Karl III, and the Grand Cross of the Bulgarian Order of Cyrill and Methodius.</p>   <p>In 1914 August was involved in combat in the Galician theatre and took command of the VII Corps and was involved in fighting in the Carpathian Mountains. After Italy became involved in the war he was transferred to the Carinthian border and involved in fighting the Isonzo army. August remained on this front until the 9th battle of the Isonzo in 1916 a period in which once again he was highly decorated. August was highly liked by his troops, especially those of Hungarian nationality.</p>   <p>In November 1916 August was put in command of the Heeresfront fighting against Russian and Romanian forces. In January 1918 he was put in command of the 6th army in the Southern theatre and that July took over the Armeegruppe Tirol, which was the 10th and 11th Armies. Finally he was put in command of the Heeresgruppe KÃ¶vess in Balkan theatre. He became the last field marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) of the Austro-Hungarian Army on October 24, 1918, as an attempt by Kaiser Karl to calm Hungarian nationalists.</p>   <p>On October 27, 1918 Kaiser Karl made August the ""Homo Regius"" of Hungary, but August asked to be released from his oath of allegiance from the Kaiser. He then began negotiations and appointed Graf JÃ¡nos Hadik to build a new national government. However a Bolshevik revolution broke out on October 31, 1918, deterring his plans. This revolution was to fail and the popular August survived unharmed and once again became the head of state ""Reichsverweser"" and appointed a Prime Minister. He did however want to restore Kaiser Karl back to the throne and because of this was forced to abdicate in 23 October 1919. In 1927 he became a member of the newly established House of Lords. He later became an honorary member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and was its president from 1936-1944. He fled Hungary for the United States in 1944 but later returned to Germany. He died in 1962 at Rain near Straubing.</p>   <p>His eldest son Archduke Joseph Francis of Austria had predeceased him, dying in 1957.</p> <p><img alt=""Archduke Joseph August"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2AF0DF4B-1517-6111-2845C070084B090A.jpg"" title=""Archduke Joseph August"" width=""263""/> </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He permanently renounced the nobility and the title ""Marquis"" before the French National Assembly on 19 June 1790. Lafayette served in the American Revolutionary War both as a general and as a diplomat. He served entirely without pay in both roles, which he was able to do due to his family's immense wealth as feudal landowners. Later, he was to prove a key figure in the early phases of the French Revolution, serving in the Estates General and the subsequent National Constituent Assembly. He was a leading figure among the Feuillants, who tried to turn France into a constitutional monarchy, and commander of the French National Guard.</p>   <p>Accused by Jean-Paul Marat of responsibility for the ""Massacre of the Champ de Mars"" (before which Lafayette was nearly assassinated), he subsequently was forced out of a leading role in the Revolution by Jacobin-Terror anarchists. On 19 August 1792 the Jacobin party seized control of Paris and the National Assembly, ordering Lafayette's arrest. He fled France and was arrested by the Austrian army in Rochefort, Belgium. Thereafter, he spent five years in various Prussian / Austrian prisons allied with the British Empire. After a strenuous effort by his wife, that was aided by the French Directory that forced Napoleon's Army toward Austria, he was released in 1797; however, Napoleon did not want Lafayette to return to France and hoped he would leave forever to the United States. After three years in exile he quietly returned (aided again by his wife) and  continued to be active in French and European politics until his death in 1834.</p> <h3><strong>About Georges Mouton, comte de Lobau</strong></h3>   <p>Georges Mouton, comte de Lobau (1770-1838) was a French soldier and political figure who rose to the rank of Marshal of France.</p>   <p>Born in Phalsbourg, Lorraine, he enlisted in the French Revolutionary Army in 1792. Serving in the early campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars, he by 1800 he was promoted to the rank of colonel.</p>   <p>Promoted to gÃ©nÃ©ral de brigade in 1805, after the establishment of the French Empire, and gÃ©nÃ©ral de division in 1807, Lobau distinguished himself in the battles of Jena and Aspern, LÃ¼tzen, Bautzen. During the Russian Campaign, he acted as a senior aide-de-camp to Emperor Napoleon I of France, whom he accompanied back to France. In 1810, he was created count of Lobau in recognition of his role in the battle of Aspern.</p>   <p>After Dominique Vandamme was made prisoner during the battle of Kulm, Lobau commanded the retreat of the remnants of the corps. He served under Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr when, upon the retreat after the battle of Leipzig, the latter was trapped in Dresden and after the surrender of these forces he became a prisoner of the Austrian Empire for the rest of the war.</p>   <p>During the Hundred Days, Lobau rallied to Napoleon and was made commander of the VI Infantry Corps which he led in the battles of Ligny and Waterloo.</p>   <p>After the Second Restoration, Lobau was forced to go into exile until he was allowed to return to France in 1818. He was elected to the House of Representatives from 1828 to 1830 as a liberal, and, in 1830, he joined the July Revolution as commander of the National Guard.</p>   <p>As a reward for his services to King Louis-Philippe he was made a Marshal in 1831, the same year he was made a Peer of France. In 1832 and 1834, Lobau was assigned to suppress insurrections, a task in which he was successful. George Mouton, comte de Lobau died in Paris.</p>   <h3><strong>About Adolphe Claude Michel Catherine Forel</strong></h3>   <p>The only information we have available on M.

Leopold was later created the Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow. He was diagnosed with hemophilia as a baby, which later led to his death as an adult.</p> <p>As a consequence of his hemophilia, Leopold would never be able to pursue a military career like his brothers, and instead undertook royal duties for his mother the Queen, acting as her secretary. He attempted to undertake official appointments in Australia and Canada but both countries would not accept him because of his health issues; he did, however, manage to pursue other aspects of royal duties, and having a passion for literature became a patron of the arts.</p>   <p>Prince Leopold preferred independence beyond the overprotective grasp of his mother who wanted him to stay at home with her. He considered marriage as the only way out of this problem, but because of his condition he was shunned by the many romantic liaisons he worked to develop. Leopold was introduced to Alice Liddell (the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice in Wonderland)</em>, and various members of European nobility, but after numerous rejections the Queen stepped in and introduced him to Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont, to whom he was happily married in April 1882.</p>   <p><strong>Prince Leopold's Death in France</strong></p>   <p>The Prince went to Cannes, France, on doctor's orders in February 1884: joint pain is a common symptom of hemophilia and the winter climate in England was always difficult for him. His wife, pregnant at the time, stayed home but urged him to go. On 27 March he slipped and fell in the Yacht Club in Villa Nevada, Cannes, injuring his knee and he died in the early hours of the next morning, apparently from the effects of the morphine he had been given and the claret that was served with his supper. He was buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel at Windsor. His posthumous son, Prince Charles Edward, succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Albany upon birth. In 1900, Charles Edward succeeded his uncle Alfred as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.</p>   <p>His passing was celebrated by the Scottish ""poet and tragedian"" William McGonagall in the poem ""The Death of Prince Leopold"".</p>   <p>Through Charles Edward, Leopold is the great-grandfather of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the current King of Sweden.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Leopold was later created the Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow. He was diagnosed with hemophilia as a baby, which later led to his death as an adult.<br/><br/>Leopold was born on April 7, 1853 at Buckingham Palace, London. His mother was Queen Victoria, the reigning British monarch. His father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. During labor, Queen Victoria chose to use chloroform and thus sanctioned the use of anesthesia in childbirth, recently developed by Professor James Young Simpson. As a son of the British sovereign, the newborn was styled His Royal Highness The Prince Leopold at birth. His parents named him Leopold after his great-uncle, King Leopold I of the Belgians.<br/><br/>He was baptized in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace on June 28, 1853 by The Archbishop of Canterbury, John Bird Sumner, and his godparents were his first cousin once-removed, The King of Hanover; his fourth cousin once-removed, Princess William of Prussia; his first cousin once-removed, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge; and The Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (his maternal uncle by marriage).<br/><br/>Prince Leopold, stifled by the desire of his mother, Queen Victoria, to keep him at home, saw marriage as his only hope of independence. Due to his hemophilia, he had difficulty finding a wife. Heiress Daisy Maynard was one of the women he considered as a possible bride. It has been suggested that he considered Alice Liddell, the daughter of the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford for whom <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/lewis-carroll-charles-dodgson-autograph-letter-signed-to-james-paget-signature"" target=""_blank"">Lewis Carroll</a> wrote <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, though others suggest that he preferred her sister Edith. <br/><br/>After rejection from these women, Leopold's mother stepped in to prevent what she saw as unsuitable possibilities. Insisting that the children of British monarchs should marry into other reigning Protestant families, Victoria suggested a meeting with Princess Helene Friederike, the daughter of Georg Viktor, reigning Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont. On April 27, 1882, Leopold and Helena were married, at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Leopold and Helena enjoyed a happy (although brief) marriage. In 1883, Leopold became a father when his wife gave birth to a daughter, Alice. He died shortly before the birth of his son, Charles Edward.</p> <p><img alt=""Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_97B22567-3048-C0CE-5591A21F0000D978.jpg"" title=""Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany"" width=""232""/></p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

This 8"" x 10"" watercolor sketch print, mounted on stiff cardboard, is warmly inscribed to Benjamin F. Greenhut of the Siegel-Cooper Company: ""To my good friend Ben Greenhut with best wishes / Hospital Ship ""Erin"" Southampton 16th January 1915 / Thomas J. Lipton."" Signed images of Sir Thomas Lipton's yachts are exceedingly rare.Â Partial tear at left side, not affecting signature.Â </p> <p>Sir Thomas Lipton (1848-1931) was a Scotsman of Irish parentage, a self-made man who became successful as founder of the famed Lipton Tea Company, and one of the most persistent challengers in the history of the America's Cup yacht race. By the late 19th century Lipton had acquired several yachts, many of which competed in the coveted America's Cup for several years. Though Lipton never won the race, he was affectionately known as ""the best of all losers."" In 1898, he purchased the 1,240-ton steam yacht, <em>Aegusa</em>, which he renamed the <em>Erin</em>. Lipton entertained lavishly on the <em>Erin</em>, with distinguished guests such as Great Britain's King Edward VII (who was also a longtime friend), Queen Alexandra, Princess Beatrice and her daughter, President Franklin Roosevelt, and countless illustrious people from around the world.</p> <p>During the first World War Lipton put his fleet of yachts into service, placing them at the disposal of the British Red Cross Society and the Royal Navy. The <em>Erin</em> was repainted white with a large red crossâas depicted in this original printâand re-equipped as a hospital ship, transporting doctors, nurses, and medical supplies to ports serving the war effort.</p> <p>Later in the war, Lipton consigned the <em>Erin</em> to help patrol Mediterranean waters for German submarines. On April 27, 1916, his beloved yacht (then serving under her original name HMY <em>Aegusa</em>) struck a mine off Malta and sank, losing six of her crew.</p> <p>Â <img alt=""Sir Thomas Lipton Aboard the Yacht Erin"" class=""img-responsive"" height=""325"" src=""https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_2857F57B-1517-6111-28FF85FBFE9F5982.png"" style=""font-family: verdana, arial, geneva, helvetica, sans-serif"" title=""Sir Thomas Lipton Aboard the Yacht Erin"" width=""410""/><br/><em>Sir Thomas Lipton Aboard </em>Erin<em> with WWI Medical Personnel<br/>[Image for reference only; not included]</em></p>  ",1915,750,0,FALSE,3915,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/284DF5D0-1517-6111-28E9F3FABF33047F.jpg,

Note:  we are unable to ascertain at this time  whether or not this letter is actually in the hand of Marie or perhaps a  secretary, therefore it is being offered as a secretarial letter from  that time period.</p> <p>Translated in full:</p> <blockquote><p>My Dear Duke,</p></blockquote> <blockquote>The brilliance of gold cannot overwhelm me, nor threats intimidate me as I strive to reclaim a position which belongs to me and of which I am worthy.  Why, My Dear Duke, has neither the King, nor Monsieur seen fit to come to my side to confront those who accuse me?  Do they claim that there are powerful enchanters who prevent uncles from recognising a niece who would have given her life to see their return.  What is it that would compromise their dignity than to have them come? That could well be true, My Dear Duke, since Monsieur Blondel one day had the temerity to maintain in one of his sermons that priestly dignity should take precedence over Royal Dignity.  I could not help but be amused at his folly, which surely enflamed his puffed up arrogance with which he looked upon me at the time.<br/></blockquote> <blockquote>I am aware, My Dear Duke, that they have said that I am badly brought up, a Petty Bourgeois.  These men, almost all of them come from nothing, surrounded by their close circle of penitents, are not competent to judge whether I have been well or badly brought up.<br/></blockquote> <blockquote>I also know, My Dear Duke, that they say that the proof that I sought to ascend to my Father's throne is that they poisoned me.  It is a great shame for these poor beings who only live to commit crimes, that such a plot is not dealt with by the courts, that it should not, or could not any longer be considered criminal, if they say it is for the good of the State that they are found guilty.  This wayward son does not even merit statues in his name, not even as a Brutus.  If he had dared say âyes, I killed the person who came to me'.  If he had dared say âyes, I plunged a dagger into the side of she who, at risk to her own life, carried me for nine months. But it is not the thirst for riches nor any other passion that such a low act brings, that made me carry out this terrible act that shakes the very core of nature, but it was rather because he or she wished to overturn the throne, even make an attempt upon His Majesty or any prince of the court he chose to name.<br/></blockquote> <blockquote><p>But why, if these men declare such strong allegiance to the King do they commit such dark deeds when it profits them not?  Did they not poison Bonaparte, who had taken the French throne, instead of me.  I, who have not, and have not still all my forebears and kin, but only the courage and the wish to do what it appears that God wants me to do and that I was born to do.</p></blockquote> <blockquote>My Dear Duke, would that your favour with Monsieur work to break these cursed ties which keep me so far away from my family to which I do so strongly wish to return.  If I may dare say so, it is indeed your duty so to do, as you are French, and, My Dear Duke, you love Monsieur, as you so loved my Father.<br/></blockquote> <blockquote>Please be assured, My Dear Duke, of my Highest Esteem.<br/>Yours,	Marie</blockquote> <blockquote>Paris, 26th October 1816</blockquote> <div align=""center""><br/> </div> <div align=""center"">Â </div> <p><strong>Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se de France</strong> aka Marie ThÃ©rÃ¨se Charlotte (1778-1851) was the eldest child of King Louis XVI of France and his wife, Queen Marie Antoinette.

His reign began at age 28âfrom 1670 to 1723âbeing the elder son of Grand Duke Ferdinando II. Cosimo's 53-year long reign, the longest in Tuscan history, was marked by a series of ultra-reactionary laws that regulated prostitution and banned May celebrations. His reign also witnessed Tuscany's deterioration to previously unknown economic lows. He was succeeded by his elder surviving son, Gian Gastone, when he died in 1723.</p> <p>He married Marguerite Louise d'OrlÃ©ans, a cousin of France's Louis XIV. It was a marriage fraught with tribulation, and Marguerite Louise eventually abandoned Tuscany for the Convent of Montmartre. Together, they had 3 children: Ferdinando in 1663, Anna Maria Luisa, Electress Palatine, in 1667, and Gian Gastone, the last Medicean ruler of Tuscany, in 1671.</p> <p>In later life, Cosimo attempted to have Anna Maria Luisa recognized as the universal heiress of Tuscany, but Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, would not allow it because Florence was nominally an imperial fief, and he felt he alone could alter the Tuscan laws of succession. All Cosimo's efforts to salvage the plan failed and, in 1737 upon his younger son's death, Tuscany passed to the House of Lorraine.</p> <p>Cosimo III left Tuscany one of the poorest nations in Europe; its treasury empty and the people weary of religious bigotry, the state itself was reduced to a gaming chip in European affairs. Among his enduring edicts is the establishment of the Chianti wine region.</p>  ",1709,1400,0,FALSE,3553,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/608B659D-1517-6111-284A7C1A4484AAB8.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/608C017F-1517-6111-2822B1CECC9FD204.png",

He was the third Avignon Pope, known for reforming monastic orders and his opposition to nepotism. Politically unable to establish his capital to Rome, he started the great palace at Avignon. One of Benedict's most significant failures, however, was his inability to curb the conflict between England and France, which began during his pontificate and came to be known as the Hundred Years' War (1337-1453).

On the obverse it depicted, originally somewhat crudely, the early Fathers of the Church of Rome, the Apostles Saint Peter and Saint Paul, identified by the letters Sanctus PAulus and Sanctus PEtrus (thus, SPA â¢SPE or SPASPE). St. Paul, on the left, was shown with flowing hair and a long pointed beard composed of curved lines, while St. Peter, on the right, was shown with curly hair and a shorter beard made of dome-shaped globetti (beads in relief). Each head was surrounded by a circle of globetti, and the rim of the seal was surrounded by an additional ring of such beads, while the heads themselves were separated by a depiction of a cross. On the reverse was the name of the issuing pope in the nominative Latin form, with the letters ""PP"", for Pastor Pastorum (""Shepherd of Shepherds""). This disc was then attached to the document either by cords of hemp, in the case of letters of justice and executory letters, or by red and yellow silk, in the case of letters of grace, that was looped through slits in the vellum of the document. The term ""bulla"" derives from the Latin ""bullire"" (""""to boil""""), and alludes to the fact that, whether of wax, lead, or gold, the material making the seal had to be melted to soften it for impression.</span></p>  ",c1334,450,0,FALSE,3899,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/803B060E-1517-6111-28475F33B02FFEC9.jpg, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/E2763937-1517-6111-28286C1DFE998678.jpg",

He was earlier appointed cardinal, in 1489 at the age of 14, the last non-priest to assume the papacy.</p> <p>Elected pope by the younger cardinals in 1513, Leo X took his responsibilities seriously. At religious ceremonies he presided with dignity and devotion. To preserve orthodoxy he threatened Martin Luther with penalties should he fail to recant forty-one propositions (<em>Exsurge Domine</em>, 1520); he then excommunicated the recalcitrant friar in 1521. To Henry VIII he assigned also in 1521 the title ""Defender of the Faith"" for writing against Luther.

While negotiating with kings and emperors for the future of Europe, Leo found time for the pleasures he loved. Artists, writers, and musicians came to Rome from all over Italy at his request. He employed Michelangelo to carve the Medici tombs in Florence, and in Rome he commissioned Raphael to work on the frescoes in the papal apartments and loggia, design the tapestries in the Sistine Chapel, paint his papal portrait, and supervise the construction of the new St. Peter's Basilica and excavations of Roman archeological sites. He set up a Greek printing press in Rome and encouraged the Jewish community in the city to begin their own printing operation. Church positions were found for writers, poets, and translators, some of the more favored of whom he made bishops. Leo himself was a master of classical Latin and delighted in giving impromptu speeches in the style of Cicero. He commissioned plays and had them performed before his court. As a connoisseur of the arts, he was unequaled in Europe. While he was pope, Rome became the cultural center of the West.</p> <p>Leo particularly liked to hunt and did so in a grand style. The Pope and his entourage beginning a chase was as much a show for the Roman people as a sport for the papal court. He would frequently attend Mass before he set out and would sometimes offer the Mass himself. But religion, although valuable, never interfered with what he considered the important demands of his position. When the papal finances began to show the strain of Leo's extravagant expenses, he unhesitatingly made use of his religious powers for added income. He demanded a fee from all new bishops and cardinals and authorized the selling of indulgences throughout Germany to obtain money for a grand rebuilding of Saint Peter's Basilica, Rome's most important church.</p> <p>A polished Renaissance prince, Leo was also a devious politician and a nepotist. His aim was to keep Italy and his own Florence free from foreign domination and to advance his family outside Florence. When he discovered a plot in his own palace to poison him, Leo had one cardinal executed and another put in prison. To neutralize the power of the remaining officials, he created 31 new cardinals, all members of his own family or people he could otherwise trust. One of his last political moves was to form another alliance with Emperor Charles V and King Henry VIII of England to drive the French out of northern Italy again. His first cousin Giulio de' Medici (1478-1534), whom he appointed archbishop of Florence, cardinal, and vice-chancellor of the church, was his closest adviser and would eventually succeed him as Clement VII (reigned 1523-1534). By his lavish expenditures on culture and warfare, and despite his efforts to raise new revenues by the sale of venal offices, dispensations, and indulgences, Leo X left the papacy deeply in debt at the time of his sudden death from malaria.</p>  ",1517,sold,1,FALSE,3626,"https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/59A247A7-1517-6111-28CF1BF70D799FEC.png, https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/09901122-1517-6111-28239FDE9FDA54FF.png",

When Florian was proclaimed Emperor in 276 upon the death of Tacitus, Probus commanded the Roman east and refused to recognize him. Their armies met at Tarsus, and after a standoff, Florian was killed by his men in August, 276. Probus then rescued Gaul from barbarian invasions, and later set about clearing the east of barbarians and bandits. By 282 the Empire was at peace and Probus turned the army to civil construction.

Leopold was later created the Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow. He was diagnosed with hemophilia as a baby, which later led to his death as an adult.</p> <p>As a consequence of his hemophilia, Leopold would never be able to pursue a military career like his brothers, and instead undertook royal duties for his mother the Queen, acting as her secretary. He attempted to undertake official appointments in Australia and Canada but both countries would not accept him because of his health issues; he did, however, manage to pursue other aspects of royal duties, and having a passion for literature became a patron of the arts.</p>   <p>Prince Leopold preferred independence beyond the overprotective grasp of his mother who wanted him to stay at home with her. He considered marriage as the only way out of this problem, but because of his condition he was shunned by the many romantic liaisons he worked to develop. Leopold was introduced to Alice Liddell (the inspiration for Lewis Carroll's <em>Alice in Wonderland)</em>, and various members of European nobility, but after numerous rejections the Queen stepped in and introduced him to Princess Helena of Waldeck and Pyrmont, to whom he was happily married in April 1882.</p>   <p><strong>Prince Leopold's Death in France</strong></p>   <p>The Prince went to Cannes, France, on doctor's orders in February 1884: joint pain is a common symptom of hemophilia and the winter climate in England was always difficult for him. His wife, pregnant at the time, stayed home but urged him to go. On 27 March he slipped and fell in the Yacht Club in Villa Nevada, Cannes, injuring his knee and he died in the early hours of the next morning, apparently from the effects of the morphine he had been given and the claret that was served with his supper. He was buried in the Albert Memorial Chapel at Windsor. His posthumous son, Prince Charles Edward, succeeded him as 2nd Duke of Albany upon birth. In 1900, Charles Edward succeeded his uncle Alfred as Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.</p>   <p>His passing was celebrated by the Scottish ""poet and tragedian"" William McGonagall in the poem ""The Death of Prince Leopold"".</p>   <p>Through Charles Edward, Leopold is the great-grandfather of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, the current King of Sweden.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Born a member of an Anglo-Indian family, he was educated at Charterhouse and at Merton College, Oxford. He joined the Bombay infantry in 1836, but, owing to his talent for languages, was soon given a political post. In 1843 he translated the Persian Kessahi Sanjan, or History of the Arrival of the Parsees in India; and he wrote a Life of Zoroaster, a Sindhi vocabulary, and various papers in the transactions of the Bombay Asiatic Society. Compelled by ill-health to return to Europe, he went to Frankfurt, where he learned German and translated Schiller's Revolt of the Netherlands and Bopp's Comparative Grammar. He married in 1847, Rosina, daughter of James Hunter, of Hafton, Argyllshire, with whom he had one son and six daughters.</p> <p>In 1845 he was appointed professor of Hindustani at Haileybury College. Two years later he published a Hindustani grammar, and, in subsequent years, a new edition of Saadi's GulistÃ¡n, with a translation in prose and verse, also an edition with vocabulary of the Hindi translation of Chatur Chuj Misr's Prem Sagar, and translations of the Bagh-o-Bahar, and of the Anwar-i Suhaili of Bidpai. In 1851 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p> <p>In 1857-1858 he edited The Autobiography of Latfullah. He also edited for the Bible Society the Book of Genesis in the Dakhani language.

In 1866 he became private secretary to the secretary of state for India, Lord Cranborne (afterwards marquess of Salisbury), and in 1867 went, as in 1864, on a government mission to Venezuela. He resigned his commission as a Major in the London Rifle Volunteer Brigade in June 1861.</p> <p>On his return he wrote, at the request of Charles Dickens, for All the Year Round, ""Sketches of Life in a South American Republic.""

In 1875 he received the degree of M.A. with the franchise from the University of Oxford, ""as a slight recognition of distinguished services.""

Leopold was later created the Duke of Albany, Earl of Clarence and Baron Arklow. He was diagnosed with hemophilia as a baby, which later led to his death as an adult.<br/><br/>Leopold was born on April 7, 1853 at Buckingham Palace, London. His mother was Queen Victoria, the reigning British monarch. His father was Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. During labor, Queen Victoria chose to use chloroform and thus sanctioned the use of anesthesia in childbirth, recently developed by Professor James Young Simpson. As a son of the British sovereign, the newborn was styled His Royal Highness The Prince Leopold at birth. His parents named him Leopold after his great-uncle, King Leopold I of the Belgians.<br/><br/>He was baptized in the Private Chapel of Buckingham Palace on June 28, 1853 by The Archbishop of Canterbury, John Bird Sumner, and his godparents were his first cousin once-removed, The King of Hanover; his fourth cousin once-removed, Princess William of Prussia; his first cousin once-removed, Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge; and The Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg (his maternal uncle by marriage).<br/><br/>Prince Leopold, stifled by the desire of his mother, Queen Victoria, to keep him at home, saw marriage as his only hope of independence. Due to his hemophilia, he had difficulty finding a wife. Heiress Daisy Maynard was one of the women he considered as a possible bride. It has been suggested that he considered Alice Liddell, the daughter of the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford for whom <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/lewis-carroll-charles-dodgson-autograph-letter-signed-to-james-paget-signature"" target=""_blank"">Lewis Carroll</a> wrote <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, though others suggest that he preferred her sister Edith. <br/><br/>After rejection from these women, Leopold's mother stepped in to prevent what she saw as unsuitable possibilities. Insisting that the children of British monarchs should marry into other reigning Protestant families, Victoria suggested a meeting with Princess Helene Friederike, the daughter of Georg Viktor, reigning Prince of Waldeck-Pyrmont. On April 27, 1882, Leopold and Helena were married, at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Leopold and Helena enjoyed a happy (although brief) marriage. In 1883, Leopold became a father when his wife gave birth to a daughter, Alice. He died shortly before the birth of his son, Charles Edward.</p> <p><img alt=""Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_97B22567-3048-C0CE-5591A21F0000D978.jpg"" title=""Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany"" width=""232""/></p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

 Grigori Rasputin, Grigori,Rasputin,World History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rasputin-grigori-rasputin-signed-sketch-russian-orthodox-cross-autograph-signature/,Signed Rasputin Sketch with Cross,"  <p>One of the more curious items we've come across in many years is this <strong>Signed Pencil Sketch of Grigori Rasputin</strong>, the Russian mystic in the Romanov court of Nicholas II and Alexandra, the last Imperial family of tsarist Russia. Uncannily depicting Rasputin's scraggly image, rendered on 6"" x 8"" toned paper, it is unknown who actually drew the sketch, but it has been authentically signed by Rasputin (the German notation at the top, added later by the original collector, is discussed below). Examples of Rasputin's extremely scarce signature can be found at <a href=""http://www.havelshouseofhistory.com/Autographs%20of%20Religious%20Leaders%20RAN-RAT.htm"" target=""_blank"">Havel's House of History</a>, where they have documented an exhaustive reference to religious autograph exemplars.<br/><br/>This remarkable Rasputin artifact is accompanied by an <strong>antique enameled pectoral cross pendant</strong>, reputedly owned by Rasputin himselfâthough we have no evidence of this apart from the decisive and enthusiastic typewritten statement in German above the sketch: ""<strong>This holy cross belonged to Rasputin personally!</strong>"" We have acquired several authentic historical items from this particular 19th-century collector's estate in Switzerland, and are no longer surprised by such claims (you can find similar exclamations on <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/geronimo-apache-leader-autograph-signed-postcard-1904"">Geronimo</a> and <a href=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/rain-in-the-face-signature-autograph-signed-1893-columbian-exposition-custer-little-big-horn"">Chief Rain-in-the-Face</a>); a Letter of Provenance and additional information can be furnished to interested buyers.<br/><br/>The small brass cross is intricately fashioned in the Russian Orthodox style dating from the 19th century. It is 3"" tall, 1.25"" wide, 3/16"" thick, enameled in dark and light blues on the front and dark red on the back. At the top is a suspension ring, beneath which is the Slavonic abbreviation for ""<em>King of Glory</em>"" and ""<em>Jesus Christ</em>"". Inlaid in the enamel is the three-bar cross of St. Andrew. At the base of the cross are four Slavonic letters meaning ""<em>The place of the skull became Paradise</em>"", with the skull of Adam shown ""hidden in a cave under the earth."" On the back is the traditional Slavonic inscription from Psalm 68: ""<em>Let God arise and let His enemies be scattered</em>..."".<br/><br/>The Bolshevik Revolution in 1917 decimated the Russian wealthy class, abruptly ending the profligate acquisition of luxury goods such as enamels, porcelains, and paintings. Many of these pieces found their way to Western Europe and America as Russian Ã©migrÃ©s sold them in order to survive. In the 1920s the Bolsheviks, hard pressed for cash, sold tsarist treasures and other art and antiques to wealthy collectors and dealers, dispersing such rarities as most of the Imperial Easter Eggs created by Faberge for the tsars.<br/><br/><strong>GRIGORI YEFIMOVICH RASPUTIN</strong> (1869-1916) was a Russian mystic who is perceived as having influenced the later days of the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, his wife the Tsaritsa Alexandra, and their only son the Tsarevich Alexei Nicholaievich. Rasputin had often been called the ""Mad Monk"", while others considered him to be a psychic and faith healer. There has been much uncertainty over Rasputin's life and influence, for accounts of his life have often been based on dubious memoirs, hearsay, and legend.<br/><br/>Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, in Siberia. Not much is known about his childhood, but the myths surrounding Rasputin portray him as showing indications of supernatural powers throughout his childhood. <br/><br/>When he was around the age of eighteen, he spent three months in the Verkhoturye Monastery, possibly a penance for theft. His experience there, combined with a reported vision of the Mother of God on his return, turned him towards the life of a religious mystic and wanderer. It also appears that he came into contact with the banned Christian sect known as the <em>khlysty</em> (flagellants), whose impassioned services, ending in physical exhaustion, led to rumors that religious and sexual ecstasy were combined in these rituals.<br/><br/>Rasputin married Praskovia Fyodorovna Dubrovina in 1889, and they had three children, named Dmitri, Varvara, and Maria. Rasputin also had another child with another woman. In 1901, he left his home in Pokrovskoye as a pilgrim and, during the time of his journeying, travelled to Greece and Jerusalem. In 1903, Rasputin arrived in Saint Petersburg, where he gradually gained a reputation as a <em>staryetz</em> (holy man) with healing and prophetic powers.<br/><br/>In 1905 the young Tsarevich sustained a bruise after falling off a horse. A hemophiliac, the young Alexei suffered internal bleeding for days. His mother, Alexandra, asked a close friend, Anna Vyrubova, to secure the help of the charismatic monk Rasputin. Word had reached the royal court that Rasputin was said to possess the ability to heal through prayer, and he was indeed able to give the boy some relief, in spite of the doctors' prediction that he would die. It was said that every time the boy had an injury that caused him internal or external bleeding, the Tsaritsa called on Rasputin, and Alexei subsequently got better-making it appear that Rasputin was effectively healing him.<br/><br/>It wasn't long after that Tsar Nicholas referred to Rasputin as ""our friend"" and a ""holy man"", a sign of the trust that the family placed in him. Rasputin had a considerable personal and political influence on Alexandra, and the Tsar and Tsaritsa considered him a man of God and a religious prophet. Everyone desirous of an audience with the royal couple had to go through him, a situation that angered certain individuals. Alexandra came to believe that God spoke to her through Rasputin.<br/><br/>Rasputin soon became a controversial figure, becoming involved in a paradigm of sharp political struggle involving monarchist, anti-monarchist, revolutionary and other political forces and interests. Though while fascinated by him, the Saint Petersburg elite did not widely accept Rasputin: he did not fit in with the royal family, and he and the Russian Orthodox Church had a very tense relationship.<br/><br/>While Tsar Nicholas was away at the front during World War I, Rasputin's influence over Tsaritsa Alexandra increased immensely. He soon became her confidant and personal adviser, and also convinced her to fill some governmental offices with his own handpicked candidates. To further the advance of his power, Rasputin cohabitated with upper-class women in exchange for granting political favors. Because of the war and the ossifying effects of feudalism and a meddling government bureaucracy, Russia's economy was declining at a rapid rate. Many at the time laid the blame with Alexandra and, because of his influence over her, with Rasputin as well.<br/><br/>The legends recounting the death of Rasputin are perhaps even more bizarre than his strange life. His murder has become legend, some of it invented by the very men who killed him, which is why it becomes difficult to discern exactly what happened.<br/><br/>It is, however, generally agreed that, on December 16, 1916, having decided that Rasputin's influence over the Tsaritsa had made him a far-too-dangerous threat to the empire, a group of nobles, led by Prince Felix Yusupov and the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich (one of the few Romanov family members to escape the annihilation of the family during the Red Terror), apparently lured Rasputin to the Yusupovs' Moika Palace, where they served him cakes and red wine laced with a massive amount of cyanide. According to legend, Rasputin was unaffected, although Vasily Maklakov had supplied enough poison to kill five men. <br/><br/>Determined to finish the job, Yusupov became anxious about the possibility that Rasputin might live until the morning, which would leave the conspirators with no time to conceal his body. Yusupov ran upstairs to consult the others and then came back down to shoot Rasputin through the back with a revolver. Rasputin fell, and the company left the palace for a while. Yusupov, who had left without a coat, decided to return to grab one, and, while at the palace, he went to check up on the body. Suddenly, Rasputin opened his eyes and lunged at Prince Yusupov. When he grabbed Prince Yusupov he ominously whispered in Yusupovs ear ""you bad boy"" and attempted to strangle him. As he made his bid to kill Yusupov, however, the other conspirators arrived and fired at him. After being hit three times in the back, Rasputin fell once more. As they neared his body, the group found that, remarkably, he was still alive, struggling to get up. They clubbed him into submission and, after wrapping his body in a sheet, threw him into an icy river, where he finally met his end.<br/><br/>Three days later, the body of Rasputin, poisoned, shot four times and badly beaten, was recovered from the Neva River.</p> <p>Â <img alt=""Grigori Rasputin"" height=""350"" src=""http://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/zoomlg_78F1D5F7-3048-C0CE-5570EAA0C5D282E8.jpg"" title=""Grigori Rasputin"" width=""228""/></p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

Mayer sent each of his five sons to a prominent European commercial centre in order to found branches of the family banking empire; James therefore moved to Paris in 1811 and in 1817 expanded the family banking empire to the city, opening de Rothschild FrÃ¨res. An advisor to two kings of France, he became the most powerful banker in the country and following the Napoleonic Wars, played a major role in financing the construction of railroads and the mining business that helped make France an industrial power. Along the way, he added to his fortune with investments in such things as the importation of tea and the wine industry. A strong-willed and shrewd businessman, James de Rothschild amassed a fortune that made him one of the richest men in the world. Although his papers have never been disclosed, evidence suggests that in today's money, James de Rothschild's personal fortune (not including the wealth of his other family members) must have been at least five times the fortune accumulated by Bill Gates.Â  </p>  ",1844,sold,1,FALSE,3571,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/4EBF41B7-1517-6111-281718F33329A2DD.png,
Spanish Prisoner Letter,Spanish Prisoner Letter,,World History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/original-spanish-prisoner-scam-letter-authentic/,Original Spanish Prisoner Letter,"  <p>Long before the well-known Nigerian money-transfer scam appeared in email inboxes worldwide, the ""Spanish Prisoner"" con, having begun in the 18th century, was among the first of such schemes to separate people from their money.</p> <p>In its original form, the confidence trickster tells his victim (the mark) that he is a wealthy person of high estate who has been imprisoned in Spain under a false identity. Some versions had the imprisoned person being an unknown or remote relative of the mark. Supposedly the prisoner cannot reveal his identity without serious repercussions, and is relying on a friend (the confidence trickster) to raise money to secure his release.</p> <p>Here we have a truly remarkable piece of criminal historyâan actual original ""Spanish Prisoner"" scam letter, sent by the supposed inmate of a Barcelona prison in 1924 to a prominent builder in New Hampshire requesting help in liberating the sum of $360,000 (adjusted for inflation, the equivalent today would be $5.2 million).</p> <p>Sent from Barcelona, dated February 21, 1924, this letter was sent to George M.

 Alexander the Great, Alexander,the Great,World History,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/index.cfm/page/antique-map-alexander-the-great-conquests-emanuel-bowen/,Antique Map of Alexander the Great's Conquests,"  <p>Beautiful engraved hand-colored antique map dated 1732, by the distinguished 18th-century cartographer Emanuel Bowen, depicting the broad and impressive extent of conquests by young Alexander the Great, whose empireâby the time of his death at age 32âcomprised a good part of the known world.</p> <h4>About Alexander the Great</h4> <p>Born into Macedonian royalty in 356 B.C.E., Alexander was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle until he was 16. Succeeding his assassinated father to the throne in 336, Alexander inherited a strong kingdom and a highly accomplished army. Following in the path of his father's military expansion plans, in 334 Alexander invaded the Achaemenid Empire, ruled Asia Minor, and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. In a series of decisive battles he subsequently conquered the entire Persian Empire, at which point his own empire now stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River, as depicted on the far right edge of this historical map. </p> <p>Though his military conquests were significant in themselves, Alexander's legacy extended well beyond battle. His campaigns resulted in substantial trade between East and West, and vast areas east of Macedonia were heavily exposed to Greek civilization and influence. Many of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, some surviving into the 21st century. </p> <p><strong>Emanuel Bowen</strong> (1694?-1767) was an English map engraver who worked for King George II of England and King Louis XV of France. Working from his London studio at around age 20, Bowen produced some of the most attractive maps of the century, recognized for their high quality and accuracy. A recurring feature of Bowen's work was his habit of filling every corner and space of the map with jottings and footnotes, both historical and topographical, as can be seen in this map of Alexander's conquests.</p> <p>One of his earliest engraved works was Britannia Depicta, published in 1720 and featuring over two hundred road maps together with a miniature county map of England and Wales. It was an unusual feature of the atlas that the maps were engraved on both sides of each page, and this resulted in a handier sized book. </p>  ",1732,sold,1,FALSE,3636,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/6AD0ADA8-1517-6111-2834682A405F817D.png,"Alexander the Great,  Emanuel Bowen"

He later studied law in England at University College London and was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn (1876). Wu became the first ethnically Chinese barrister in history. After being called to the bar in England, he returned to practice law in Hong Kong. Later, Wu became the first ethnically Chinese unofficial member of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong (appointed 1880).  </p>   <p>He served under the Qing Dynasty as Minister to the United States, Spain, and Peru from 1896 to 1902 and from 1907 to 1909. In this role he lectured widely about Chinese culture and history, in part working to counter discrimination against Chinese emigrants by increasing foreign appreciation of their background. To further this end, he published America, through the spectacles of an Oriental diplomat in English in 1914.</p>   <p>Wu is mentioned several times in the diaries of Sir Ernest Satow who was British Envoy in China, 1900-06. For example on 21 November 1903: ""Wu Ting-Fang came in the afternoon, and stopped talking for an hour and a half about his commercial code and connected subjects. His idea is to draft also a new criminal code, and put both into force at the outset in the open ports.""</p>   <p>He supported the Xinhai Revolution and negotiated on the revolutionaries' behalf in Shanghai. He served briefly in early 1912 as Minister of Justice for the Nanjing Provisional Government, where he argued strongly for an independent judiciary, based on his experience studying law and travelling overseas. After this brief posting, Wu became Minister of Foreign Affairs for the ROC. He served briefly in 1917 as Acting Premier of the Republic of China.</p>   <p>Wu joined Sun Yat-sen's Constitutional Protection Movement and became a member of its governing committee. He advised Sun against becoming the ""extraordinary president"" but stuck with Sun after the election. He then served as Sun's foreign minister and as acting president when Sun was absent. Wu died shortly after Chen Jiongming rebelled against Sun.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.

He completed the preliminaries despite his injury, and went on to repeat a similar dive during the finals, earning the gold medal. In the 10m finals he won the gold medal performing a 3.4 difficulty dive in his last attempt, earning in total 638.61 points, surpassing silver medalist Xiong Ni by only 1.14 points. His comeback earned him the title of ABC's <em>Wide World of Sports</em> ""Athlete of the Year"" for 1988.</p> <p>Â </p> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.
