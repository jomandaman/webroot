Q. Adams,"" as   President, one page on vellum, 9.5'' x 15.75'', dated January 3, 1828.   President Adams grants John Vannest 80 acres of land in Vermillion   County, Indiana. </strong>Document is signed at the conclusion by Adams and   countersigned by Commissioner of the General Land Office George (""G."")   W. Graham. The handwritten parts of this document have faded over the   past 185+ years, but are all still legible including President Adams'   bold signature. Two vertical folds and some mild toning and wrinkling,   otherwise fine condition. Seal missing, but adhesive stain visible.</p> <p>The   assignee in this case is the patriarch of a distinguished Indiana   family, John Vannest, the first permanent white settler in Vermillion   County, on land that lies along the Wabash River in Western Indiana.   Vannest moved to Indiana from Virginia circa 1816, and secured tracts of   government land on which the City of Clinton, Indiana now stands.   Vannest devoted his life to farming and raising a family, and also   established the first Methodist Society in Vermillion County, holding   meetings every four weeks in his barn. </p> <p>According to <em>Vermillion County, Indiana, History and Family</em> (Turner Publishing, 1989):</p> <blockquote><p><em>""Itinerant  Methodist ministers in  pioneer times were noted for their deep  convictions, powerful  preaching, and their energy and daring in  threading the wild woods and  prairies in search of the isolated settler  for the purpose of preaching  the gospel and organizing Methodist  classes."" </em></p></blockquote>  ",1828,750,False,False,3656,https://www.vintagememorabilia.com/mcms_site/uploads/images/8C1D566C-1517-6111-28B24269F3CA1269.png,

These ""Homestead Certificates""  were actually signed by American presidents up until around Andrew  Jackson's second term as president, when he turned the authority over to  secretaries.

Hatfield. As New condition, unread and unsigned, with publisher's early promotional review material included.</strong></p> <p>Threatened with litigation by powerful forces defending President George W. Bush, this first edition hardcover book was withdrawn by the publisher after only a week of retail sales, and was later issued by a different publisher as a paperback. There was significant controversy over the author's alleged felony criminal background, the book's content, and unsubstantiated drug use and arrest allegations about President Bush while he was Texas Governor. Only 70,000 copies of the book were reportedly printed to begin with. To reduce its exposure to threats of libel and other potential litigation, the publisher reportedly destroyed those still in its possession and the thousands returned after the recall. Few are presumed to have survived-and this is one of those rare copies.</p> <p>In one press article a representative of St. Martin's Press is said to have referred to this book as ""furnace fodder.""

With proof of in-person signing at Elliott Bay Book Company: original receipt and punched admission ticket.  </p> <h3>About President Clinton's Book <em>My Life</em> </h3> <p>President Bill Clinton's <em>My Life</em> is the strikingly candid portrait of a global leader who decided early in life to devote his intellectual and political gifts, and his extraordinary capacity for hard work, to serving the public. <br/> <br/> It shows us the progress of a remarkable American, who, through his own enormous energies and efforts, made the unlikely journey from Hope, Arkansas, to the White House-a journey fueled by an impassioned interest in the political process which manifested itself at every stage of his life: in college, working as an intern for Senator William Fulbright; at Oxford, becoming part of the Vietnam War protest movement; at Yale Law School, campaigning on the grassroots level for Democratic candidates; back in Arkansas, running for Congress, attorney general, and governor.<br/> <br/> We see his career shaped by his resolute determination to improve the life of his fellow citizens, an unfaltering commitment to civil rights, and an exceptional understanding of the practicalities of political life.<br/> <br/> We come to understand the emotional pressures of his youth-born after his father's death; caught in the dysfunctional relationship between his feisty, nurturing mother and his abusive stepfather, whom he never ceased to love and whose name he took; drawn to the brilliant, compelling Hillary Rodham, whom he was determined to marry; passionately devoted, from her infancy, to their daughter, Chelsea, and to the entire experience of fatherhood; slowly and painfully beginning to comprehend how his early denial of pain led him at times into damaging patterns of behavior.<br/> <br/> President Clinton's book is also the fullest, most concretely detailed, most nuanced account of a presidency ever written-encompassing not only the high points and crises but the way the presidency actually works: the day-to-day bombardment of problems, personalities, conflicts, setbacks, achievements.<br/> </p> <ul><li> It is a testament to the positive impact on America and on the world of his work and his ideals.</li><li> It is the gripping account of a president under concerted and unrelenting assault orchestrated by his enemies on the Far Right, and how he survived and prevailed. </li><li> It is a treasury of moments caught alive, among them:</li><li> The ten-year-old boy watching the national political conventions on his family's new (and first) television set.</li><li> The young candidate looking for votes in the Arkansas hills and the local seer who tells him, ""Anybody who would campaign at a beer joint in Joiner at midnight on Saturday night deserves to carry one box. . . . You'll win here. But it'll be the only damn place you win in this county."" (He was right on both counts.)</li><li> The roller-coaster ride of the 1992 campaign.</li><li> The extraordinarily frank exchanges with Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole.</li><li> The delicate manipulation needed to convince Rabin and Arafat to shake hands for the camera while keeping Arafat from kissing Rabin.</li><li> The cost, both public and private, of the scandal that threatened the presidency.</li></ul> <p>         Here is the life of a great national and international figure, revealed with all his talents and contradictions, told openly, directly, in his own completely recognizable voice. A unique book by a unique American.</p> Â  <br/> <p>All Vintage Memorabilia autographs are unconditionally guaranteed to be genuine.
